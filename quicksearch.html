This will be blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes. escc string the name of the ESCC for this chaincode. This will be blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes. vscc string the name of the VSCC for this chaincode. This will be blank if the query is returning information about installed chaincodes. ChaincodeInstallRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description targets Array.&lt;Peer&gt; Required.

Object with the transaction id and nonce orderer Orderer Optional. The orderer instance or string name of the orderer to retrieve genesis block from OrganizationConfigGroup Each participating organization of the channel gets represented in a section in the configuration block as described below. Critical information about the organzation such as its Membership Service Provider (MSP) content and its pre-defined policies that form the basis of the channel's access control policies (Admins, Writers and Readers) are contained in these sections. A organizational configuration will have the following object structure. version -- {int} mod_policy -- {string} values MSP version -- {int} mod_policy -- {string} value type -- {int} config name -- {string} root_certs -- {string[]} intermediate_certs -- {string[]} admins -- {string[]} revocation_list -- {string[]} signing_identity -- {byte[]} organizational_unit_identifiers -- {string[]} policies Admins version -- {int} mod_policy -- {string} policy -- {SignaturePolicy} Writers version -- {int} mod_policy -- {string} policy -- {SignaturePolicy} Readers version -- {int} mod_policy -- {string} policy -- {SignaturePolicy} Type: Object Policy Defines the endorsement policies Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description identities Array.&lt;Identity&gt; List of identities to be referenced in the &quot;policy&quot; section policy Array.&lt;PolicySpec&gt; The specification of the policy using a combination of &quot;signed-by&quot; and &quot;n-of&quot; structures. The design allows recursion PolicySpec Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description type Object The type of policy can be &quot;signed-by&quot; for a single identity signature or &quot;n-of&quot; where &quot;n&quot; is a numeric value. If the type property is &quot;signed-by&quot;, the value is the numeric index into the array of identities specified in the policy. If the type property is &quot;n-of&quot;, the value is an array of PolicySpec objects. As you can see, this structure allows recursive definitions of complex policies. ProcessedTransaction Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description validationCode number See this list for all the defined validation codes transactionEnvelope Object Encapsulates the transaction and the signature over it. It has the following structure: signature -- {byte[]} payload -- {} header -- {Header} data -- {Transaction} ProposalResponse A protobuf message that gets returned by endorsing peers on proposal requests. The peer node runs the target chaincode, as designated by the proposal, and decides on whether to endorse the proposal or not, and sends back the endorsement result along with the read and write sets inside the proposal response message. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description version number timestamp Timestamp Time the proposal was created by the submitter response Response payload Array.&lt;byte&gt; The payload of the response. It is the encoded bytes of the &quot;ProposalResponsePayload&quot; protobuf message endorsement Endorsement The endorsement of the proposal, basically the endorser's signature over the payload ProposalResponseObject All calls to the endorsing peers for proposal endorsement return this standard array of objects. Type: array Properties: Name Type Description index:0 array Array of ProposalResponse objects from the endorsing peers index:1 Object The original Proposal object needed when sending the transaction request to the orderer Response A response message indicating whether the endorsement of the proposal was successful Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description status number Status code.

Value can be &quot;member&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; mspId string The member service provider Id used to process the identity SignatureHeader An object that is part of all signatures in Hyperledger Fabric. The &quot;creator&quot; field has two important pieces of information about the identity of the signer, the organization (Mspid) that the signer belongs to, and the certificate (IdBytes). The &quot;nonce&quot; field is a unique value to guard against replay attacks. creator Mspid -- {string} IdBytes -- {byte[]} nonce -- {byte[]} Type: Object SignaturePolicy SignaturePolicy is a recursive message structure which defines a featherweight DSL for describing policies which are more complicated than 'exactly this signature'. The NOutOf operator is sufficent to express AND as well as OR, as well as of course N out of the following M policies. SignedBy implies that the signature is from a valid certificate which is signed by the trusted authority specified in the bytes. This will be the certificate itself for a self-signed certificate and will be the CA for more traditional certificates A &quot;SignaturePolicy&quot; will have the following object structure. type -- SIGNATURE policy Type -- n_out_of n_out_of N -- {int} policies -- {array} Type -- signed_by signed_by -- {int} identities -- {array} principal_classification -- {int} msp_identifier -- {string} Role -- MEMBER | ADMIN Type: Object TLSOptions Type: Object Properties: Name Type Argument Default Description trustedRoots Array.&lt;string&gt; Array of PEM-encoded trusted root certificates verify boolean &lt;optional&gt; true Determines whether or not to verify the server certificate when using TLS Transaction A Transaction, or &quot;Endorser Transaction&quot;, is the result of invoking chaincodes to collect endorsements, getting globally ordered in the context of a channel, and getting validated by the committer peer as part of a block before finally being formally &quot;committed&quot; to the ledger inside a Block. Each transaction contains an array of &quot;actions&quot; representing different steps for executing a transaction, and those steps will be processed atomically, meaning if any one step failed then the whole transaction will be marked as rejected. Each entry of the &quot;actions&quot; array contains a chaincode proposal and corresponding proposal responses that encapsulate the endorsing peer's decisions on whether the proposal is considered valid. Note that even if a transaction proposal(s) is considered valid by the endorsing peers, it may still be rejected by the committers during transaction validation. Whether a transaction as a whole is valid or not, is not reflected in the transaction record itself, but rather recorded in a separate field in the Block's metadata. A &quot;Transaction&quot; will have the following object structure. actions {array} header -- {SignatureHeader} payload chaincode_proposal_payload input -- {byte[]} action proposal_response_payload proposal_hash -- {byte[]} extension results data_model -- {int} ns_rwset -- {array} namespace -- {string} rwset reads -- {array} key -- {string} version block_num -- {number} tx_num -- {number} range_queries_info -- {array} writes -- {array} key -- {string} is_delete -- {boolean} value -- {string} events chaincode_id -- {string} tx_id -- {string} event_name -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} response status -- {int} message -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} endorsements -- {Endorsement[]} Type: Object TransactionRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description proposalResponses array An array or a single ProposalResponse objects containing the response from the endorsement call proposal Object A Proposal object containing the original request for endorsement(s) UserOpts Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description username string {string} - the user name used for enrollment mspid string {string} - the MSP id cryptoContent IdentityFiles | IdentityPEMs the private key and certificate × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.4 on 2017-09-06T20:00:37+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

The SDK is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime. OverviewHyperledger Fabric is the operating system of an enterprise-strength permissioned blockchain network. For a high-level overview of the fabric, visit http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Applications can be developed to interact with the blockchain network on behalf of the users. APIs are available to: create channels ask peer nodes to join the channel install chaincodes in peers instantiate chaincodes in a channel invoke transactions by calling the chaincode query the ledger for transactions or blocks How Different Components of the Fabric Work TogetherThe Transaction Flow document provides an excellent description of the application/SDK, peers, and orderers working together to process transactions and producing blocks. Security on the Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrollment certificates. For a user's enrollment certificate to be considered valid on the Fabric, it must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Fabric supports any standard CAs. In addition, Fabric provides a CA server. See this overview. Features of the SDK for Node.jsThe Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js is designed in an Object-Oriented programming style. Its modular construction enables application developers to plug in alternative implementations of key functions such as crypto suites, the state persistence store, and logging utility. The SDK's list of features include: fabric-client: create a new channel send channel information to a peer to join install chaincode on a peer instantiate chaincode in a channel, which involves two steps: propose and transact submitting a transaction, which also involves two steps: propose and transact query a chaincode for the latest application state various query capabilities: channel height block-by-number, block-by-hash all channels that a peer is part of all installed chaincodes in a peer all instantiated chaincodes in a channel transaction-by-id channel configuration data monitoring events: connect to a peer's event stream listen on block events listen on transactions events and find out if the transaction was successfully committed to the ledger or marked invalid listen on custom events produced by chaincodes serializable User object with signing capabilities hierarchical configuration settings with multiple layers of overrides: files, environment variable, program arguments, in-memory settings logging utility with a built-in logger (winston) and can be overriden with a number of popular loggers including log4js and bunyan pluggable CryptoSuite interface describe the cryptographic operations required for successful interactions with the Fabric. Two implementations are provided out of box: Software-based ECDSA PKCS#11-compliant ECDSA pluggable State Store interface for persisting state caches such as users File-based store CouchDB-base store which works with both CouchDB database and IBM Cloudant customizable Crypto Key Store for any software-based cryptographic suite implementation supports both TLS (grpcs://) or non-TLS (grpc://) connections to peers and orderers, see Remote which is the superclass for peers and orderers fabric-ca-client: register a new user enroll a user to obtain the enrollment certificate signed by the Fabric CA revoke an existing user by enrollment ID or revoke a specific certificate customizable persistence store API ReferenceThe SDK is made up of 3 top-level modules that can be accessed through the navigation menu Modules: api: pluggable APIs for application developers to supply alternative implementations of key interfaces used by the SDK.

A Channel object captures the settings needed to interact with a fabric backend in the context of a channel. These settings including the list of participating organizations, represented by instances of Membership Service Providers (MSP), the list of endorsing peers, and an orderer. A client application can use the Channel object to create new channels with the orderer, update an existing channel, send various channel-aware requests to the peers such as invoking chaincodes to process transactions or queries. A Channel object is also responsible for verifying endorsement signatures in transaction proposal responses. A channel object must be initialized after it has been configured with the list of peers and orderers. The initialization sends a get configuration block request to the primary orderer to retrieve the configuration settings for this channel. new Channel(name, clientContext) Returns a new instance of the class. This is a client-side-only call. To create a new channel in the fabric, call createChannel(). Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name to identify the channel. This value is used as the identifier of the channel when making channel-aware requests with the fabric, such as invoking chaincodes to endorse transactions. The naming of channels is enforced by the ordering service and must be unique within the fabric backend clientContext Client The client instance, which provides operational context such as the signing identity Methods addOrderer(orderer) Add the orderer object to the channel object, this is a client-side-only operation. An application may add more than one orderer object to the channel object, however the SDK only uses the first one in the list to send broadcast messages to the orderer backend. Parameters: Name Type Description orderer Orderer An instance of the Orderer class. addPeer(peer) Add the peer object to the channel object. A channel object can be optionally configured with a list of peer objects, which will be used when calling certain methods such as sendInstantiateProposal(), sendUpgradeProposal(), sendTransactionProposal. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class that has been initialized with URL and other gRPC options such as TLS credentials and request timeout. compareProposalResponseResults(The) Utility method to examine a set of proposals to check they contain the same endorsement result write sets. This will validate that the endorsing peers all agree on the result of the chaincode execution. Parameters: Name Type Description The Array.&lt;ProposalResponse&gt; proposal responses from all endorsing peers Returns: True when all proposals compare equally, false otherwise. Type boolean getChannelConfig() Asks the orderer for the current (latest) configuration block for this channel. This is similar to getGenesisBlock(), except that instead of getting block number 0 it gets the latest block that contains the channel configuration, and only returns the decoded ConfigEnvelope. Returns: A Promise for a ConfigEnvelope object containing the configuration items. Type Promise getGenesisBlock(request) A channel's first block is called the &quot;genesis block&quot;. This block captures the initial channel configuration. For a peer node to join the channel, it must be provided the genesis block. This method must be called before calling joinChannel(). Parameters: Name Type Description request OrdererRequest Optional - A transaction ID object Returns: A Promise for an encoded protobuf &quot;Block&quot; Type Promise getMSPManager() Get the MSP Manager for this channel Returns: Type MSPManager getName() Get the channel name. Returns: The name of the channel. Type string getOrderers() Returns the orderers of this channel object. Returns: The list of orderers in the channel object Type Array.&lt;Orderer&gt; getOrganizations() Get organization identifiers from the MSP's for this channel Returns: Array of MSP identifiers representing the channel's participating organizations Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getPeers() Returns the list of peers of this channel object. Returns: The peer list on the channel. Type Array.&lt;Peer&gt; initialize(config) Initializes the channel object with the Membership Service Providers (MSPs). The channel's MSPs are critical in providing applications the ability to validate certificates and verify signatures in messages received from the fabric backend. For instance, after calling sendTransactionProposal(), the application can verify the signatures in the proposal response's endorsements to ensure they have not been tampered with. This method retrieves the configuration from the orderer if no &quot;config&quot; parameter is passed in. Optionally a configuration may be passed in to initialize this channel without making the call to the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description config Array.&lt;byte&gt; Optional. An encoded (a.k.a un-decoded) byte array of the protobuf &quot;ConfigUpdate&quot; Returns: A Promise that will resolve when the action is complete Type Promise joinChannel(request, timeout) For a peer node to become part of a channel, it must be sent the genesis block, as explained here. This method sends a join channel proposal to one or more endorsing peers. Parameters: Name Type Description request JoinChannelRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance(s) and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for an array of ProposalResponse from the target peers Type Promise queryBlock(blockNumber, target, useAdmin) Queries the ledger on the target peer for Block by block number. Parameters: Name Type Description blockNumber number The number of the Block in question. target Peer Optional. The peer to send this query to. If no target is passed, the query is sent to the first peer that was added to the channel object. useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A Promise for a Block at the blockNumber slot in the ledger, fully decoded into an object. Type Promise queryBlockByHash(block, target, useAdmin) Queries the ledger on the target peer for a Block by block hash. Parameters: Name Type Description block Array.&lt;byte&gt; hash of the Block in question. target Peer Optional. The peer to send the query to. If no target is passed, the query is sent to the first peer that was added to the channel object. useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A Promise for a Block matching the hash, fully decoded into an object. Type Promise queryByChaincode(request) Sends a proposal to one or more endorsing peers that will be handled by the chaincode. In fabric v1.0, there is no difference in how the endorsing peers process a request to invoke a chaincode for transaction vs. to invoke a chaincode for query. All requests will be presented to the target chaincode's 'Invoke' method which must be implemented to understand from the arguments that this is a query request. The chaincode must also return results in the byte array format and the caller will have to be able to decode these results. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeQueryRequest Returns: A Promise for an array of byte array results returned from the chaincode on all Endorsing Peers Type Promise Example Get the list of query results returned by the chaincode channel.queryByChaincode(request) .then((response_payloads) =&gt; { for(let i = 0; i &lt; response_payloads.length; i++) { console.log(util.format('Query result from peer [%s]: %s', i, response_payloads[i].toString('utf8'))); } }); queryInfo(target, useAdmin) Queries for various useful information on the state of the Channel (height, known peers). Parameters: Name Type Description target Peer Optional. The peer that is the target for this query. If no target is passed, the query will use the first peer that was added to the channel object. useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A Promise for a BlockchainInfo object with blockchain height, current block hash and previous block hash. Type Promise queryInstantiatedChaincodes(target, useAdmin) Queries the ledger on the target peer for instantiated chaincodes on this channel. Parameters: Name Type Description target Peer Optional. The peer to send this query to. If no target is passed, the query is sent to the first peer that was added to the channel object. useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A Promise for a fully decoded ChaincodeQueryResponse object. Type Promise queryTransaction(tx_id, target, useAdmin) Queries the ledger on the target peer for Transaction by id. Parameters: Name Type Description tx_id string The id of the transaction target Peer Optional. The peer to send this query to. If no target is passed, the query is sent to the first peer that was added to the channel object. useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A Promise for a fully decoded ProcessedTransaction object. Type Promise removeOrderer(orderer) Remove the first orderer object in the channel object's list of orderers whose endpoint url property matches the url of the orderer that is passed in. Parameters: Name Type Description orderer Orderer An instance of the Orderer class. removePeer(peer) Remove the first peer object in the channel object's list of peers whose endpoint url property matches the url of the peer that is passed in. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class. sendInstantiateProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode instantiate proposal to one or more endorsing peers. A chaincode must be instantiated on a channel-by-channel basis before it can be used. The chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run, by calling client.installChaincode(). Instantiating a chaincode is a full transaction operation, meaning it must be first endorsed as a proposal, then the endorsements are sent to the orderer to be processed for ordering and validation. When the transaction finally gets committed to the channel's ledger on the peers, the chaincode is then considered activated and the peers are ready to take requests to process transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise sendTransaction(request) Send the proposal responses that contain the endorsements of a transaction proposal to the orderer for further processing. This is the 2nd phase of the transaction lifecycle in the fabric. The orderer will globally order the transactions in the context of this channel and deliver the resulting blocks to the committing peers for validation against the chaincode's endorsement policy. When the committering peers successfully validate the transactions, it will mark the transaction as valid inside the block. After all transactions in a block have been validated, and marked either as valid or invalid (with a reason code), the block will be appended (committed) to the channel's ledger on the peer. The caller of this method must use the proposal responses returned from the endorser along with the original proposal that was sent to the endorser. Both of these objects are contained in the ProposalResponseObject returned by calls to any of the following methods: installChaincode() sendInstantiateProposal() sendUpgradeProposal() sendTransactionProposal() Parameters: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest Returns: A Promise for a &quot;BroadcastResponse&quot; message returned by the orderer that contains a single &quot;status&quot; field for a standard HTTP response code. This will be an acknowledgement from the orderer of successfully submitted transaction. Type Promise sendTransactionProposal(request, timeout) Sends a transaction proposal to one or more endorsing peers. After a chaincode gets installed and instantiated, it's ready to take endorsement proposals and participating in transaction processing. A chaincode transaction starts with a proposal that gets sent to the endorsing peers, which executes the target chaincode and decides whether the proposal should be endorsed (if it executes successfully) or not (if the chaincode returns an error). Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInvokeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise sendUpgradeProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode upgrade proposal to one or more endorsing peers. Upgrading a chaincode involves steps similar to instantiating a chaincode. The new chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run. Similar to instantiating a chaincode, upgrading chaincodes is also a full transaction operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise setMSPManager(msp_manager) Set the MSP Manager for this channel. This utility method will not normally be use as the initialize() method will read this channel's current configuration and reset MSPManager with the MSP's found in the channel configuration. Parameters: Name Type Description msp_manager MSPManager The msp manager for this channel toString() return a printable representation of this channel object verifyProposalResponse(proposal_response) Utility method to verify a single proposal response. It checks the following aspects: The endorser's identity belongs to a legitimate MSP of the channel and can be successfully deserialized The endorsement signature can be successfully verified with the endorser's identity certificate This method requires that the initialize method of this channel object has been called to load this channel's MSPs. The MSPs will have the trusted root certificates for this channel. Parameters: Name Type Description proposal_response ProposalResponse The endorsement response from the peer, includes the endorser certificate and signature over the proposal + endorsement result + endorser certificate. Returns: A boolean value of true when both the identity and the signature are valid, false otherwise.

An application using the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of the Client. An important aspect of the current design of the Client class is that it is stateful. An instance must be configured with a userContext before it can be used to talk to the fabric backend. A userContext is an instance of the User class, which encapsulates the ability to sign requests. If the SDK is used in a multi-user environment, there are two recommended techniques to manage the authenticated users and instances of clients. Use a dedicated client instance per authenticated user. Create a new instance for each authenticated user. You can enroll each authenticated user separately so that each user gets its own signing identity. Use a shared client instance and a common signing identity among authenticated users. It is important to understand that switching userContexts with the same client instance is considered an anti-pattern. This is the direct result of the stateful design. A JIRA work item has been opened to discuss adding support for stateless usage of the SDK: FAB-4563 The client also supports persistence via a stateStore. A state store is a simple storage plugin that implements the module:api.KeyValueStore interface, which helps the SDK save critical information to be used across server restarts/crashes. Out of the box, the SDK saves the signing identities (instances of the User class) in the state store. new Client() Extends BaseClient Methods &lt;static&gt; loadFromConfig(config) Load a network configuration object or load a JSON file and return a Client object. Parameters: Name Type Description config object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file Returns: An instance of this class initialized with the network end points. Type Client createChannel(request) Calls the orderer to start building the new channel. A channel typically has more than one participating organizations. To create a new channel, one of the participating organizations should call this method to submit the creation request to the orderer service. Once the channel is successfully created by the orderer, the next step is to have each organization's peer nodes join the channel, by sending the channel configuration to each of the peer nodes. The step is accomplished by calling the joinChannel() method. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the create request by the orderer. Note that this is not the confirmation of successful creation of the channel. The client application must poll the orderer to discover whether the channel has been created completely or not. Type Promise createUser(opts) Returns a User object with signing identities based on the private key and the corresponding x509 certificate. This allows applications to use pre-existing crypto materials (private keys and certificates) to construct user objects with signing capabilities, as an alternative to dynamically enrolling users with fabric-ca Note that upon successful creation of the new user object, it is set to the client instance as the current userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description opts UserOpts Essential information about the user Returns: Promise for the user object. Type Promise extractChannelConfig(config_envelope) Extracts the protobuf 'ConfigUpdate' object out of the 'ConfigEnvelope' object that is produced by the configtxgen tool. The returned object may then be signed using the signChannelConfig() method of this class. Once the all signatures have been collected, the 'ConfigUpdate' object and the signatures may be used on the createChannel() or updateChannel() calls. Parameters: Name Type Description config_envelope Array.&lt;byte&gt; The encoded bytes of the ConfigEnvelope protobuf Returns: The encoded bytes of the ConfigUpdate protobuf, ready to be signed Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getChannel(name, throwError) Get a Channel instance from the client instance. This is a memory-only lookup. If the loaded network configuration has a channel by the 'name', a new channel instance will be created and populated with Orderer objects and Peer objects as defined in the network configuration. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the channel. throwError boolean Indicates if this method will throw an error if the channel is not found. Default is true. Returns: The channel instance Type Channel getCryptoSuite() Returns the CryptoSuite object used by this client instance Inherited From: BaseClient#getCryptoSuite Returns: Type module:api.CryptoSuite getStateStore() A convenience method for obtaining the state store object in use by this client. Returns: The KeyValueStore implementation object set on this Client, or null if one has not been set. Type module:api.KeyValueStore getUserContext(name, checkPersistence) Returns the user by the given name. This can be a synchronous call or asynchronous call, depending on whether &quot;checkPersistent&quot; is truthy or not. If truthy, the method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, otherwise it's synchronous. As explained above, the client instance can have an optional state store. The SDK saves enrolled users in the storage which can be accessed by authorized users of the application (authentication is done by the application outside of the SDK). This function attempts to load the user by name from the local storage (via the KeyValueStore interface). The loaded user object must represent an enrolled user with a valid enrollment certificate signed by a trusted CA (such as the CA server). Parameters: Name Type Description name String Optional. If not specified, will only return the current in-memory user context object, or null if none has been set. If &quot;name&quot; is specified, will also attempt to load it from the state store if search in memory failed. checkPersistence boolean Optional. If specified and truthy, the method returns a Promise and will attempt to check the state store for the requested user by the &quot;name&quot;. If not specified or falsey, the method is synchronous and returns the requested user from memory Returns: Promise for the user object corresponding to the name, or null if the user does not exist or if the state store has not been set. If &quot;checkPersistence&quot; is not specified or falsey, then the user object is returned synchronously. Type Promise | User initCredentialStores() Sets the state and crypto stores for use by this client. This requires that a network config has been loaded. Will use the settings from the network configuration along with the system configuration to build instances of the stores and assign them to this client. Returns: - A promise to build a key value store and crypto store. Type Promise installChaincode(request, timeout) In fabric v1.0, a chaincode must be installed and instantiated before it can be called to process transactions. Chaincode installation is simply uploading the chaincode source and dependencies to the peers. This operation is &quot;channel-agnostic&quot; and is performed on a peer-by-peer basis. Only the peer organization's ADMIN identities are allowed to perform this operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstallRequest The request object timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a ProposalResponseObject Type Promise isDevMode() Determine if the fabric backend is started in development mode. In development mode, the endorsing peers will not attempt to spin up a docker instance to run the target chaincode requested by a transaction proposal, but instead redirect the invocation requests to the chaincode process that has registered itself with the endorsing peer. This makes it easier to test changes to the chaincode during chaincode development. The client instance can be set to dev mode to reflect the backend's development mode. This will cause the SDK to make adjustments in certain behaviors such as not sending the chaincode package to the peers during chanicode install. loadFromConfig(config) Load a network configuration object or load a JSON file and update this client with any values in the config. Parameters: Name Type Description config object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file loadUserFromStateStore(name) Restore the state of the User by the given name from the key value store (if found). If not found, return null. Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name of the user Returns: A Promise for a {User} object upon successful restore, or if the user by the name does not exist in the state store, returns null without rejecting the promise Type Promise newChannel(name) Returns a Channel instance with the given name. This represents a channel and its associated ledger. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the channel. Recommend using namespaces to avoid collision. Returns: The uninitialized channel instance. Type Channel newEventHub() Returns an EventHub object. An event hub object encapsulates the properties of an event stream on a peer node, through which the peer publishes notifications of blocks being committed in the channel's ledger. Returns: The EventHub instance Type EventHub newOrderer(url, opts) Returns an Orderer object with the given url and opts. An orderer object encapsulates the properties of an orderer node and the interactions with it via the grpc stream API. Orderer objects are used by the Client objects to broadcast requests for creating and updating channels. They are used by the Channel objects to broadcast requests for ordering transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpc(s)://host:port&quot;. opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the orderer. Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer newPeer(url, opts) Returns a Peer object with the given url and opts. A peer object encapsulates the properties of an endorsing peer and the interactions with it via the grpc service API. Peer objects are used by the Client objects to send channel-agnostic requests such as installing chaincode, querying peers for installed chaincodes, etc. They are also used by the Channel objects to send channel-aware requests such as instantiating chaincodes, and invoking transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpc(s)://host:port&quot;. opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the peer. Returns: The Peer instance. Type Peer newTransactionID(If) Returns a new TransactionID object. Fabric transaction ids are constructed as a hash of a nonce concatenated with the signing identity's serialized bytes. The TransactionID object keeps the nonce and the resulting id string bundled together as a coherent pair. This method requires the client instance to have been assigned a userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description If boolean this transactionID should be built based on the admin credentials Default is a non admin TransactionID Returns: An object that contains a transaction id based on the client's userContext and a randomly generated nonce value. Type TransactionID queryChannels(peer, useAdmin) Queries the target peer for the names of all the channels that a peer has joined. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer to send the query useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: A promise to return a ChannelQueryResponse Type Promise queryInstalledChaincodes(peer, useAdmin) Queries the installed chaincodes on a peer. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. Returns: Promise for a ChaincodeQueryResponse object Type Promise saveUserToStateStore() Persist the current userContext to the key value store. Returns: A Promise for the userContext object upon successful persistence Type Promise setAdminSigningIdentity(private_key, certificate, mpsid) Set the admin signing identity object. This method will only assign a signing identity for use by this client instance and will not persist the identity. Parameters: Name Type Description private_key string the private key PEM string certificate string the PEM-encoded string of certificate mpsid string The Member Service Provider id for the local signing identity setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) Sets the client instance to use the CryptoSuite object for signing and hashing Creating and setting a CryptoSuite is optional because the client will construct an instance based on default configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one. The specific implementation is determined by the value of this configuration setting. Parameters: Name Type Description cryptoSuite module:api.CryptoSuite the CryptoSuite object Inherited From: BaseClient#setCryptoSuite setDevMode() Set dev mode to true or false to reflect the mode of the fabric backend. See Client#isDevMode for details. setStateStore(keyValueStore) Set an optional state store to persist application states. The state store must implement the module:api.KeyValueStore interface. The SDK supports persisting the User objects so that the heavy-weight objects such as the certificate and private keys do not have to be passed in repeatedly. Out of the box the SDK provides a file-based implementation, and a CouchDB-based implementation, which also supports Cloudant. Applications can provide alternative implementations. Parameters: Name Type Description keyValueStore module:api.KeyValueStore Instance of a KeyValueStore implementation setUserContext(user, skipPersistence) Sets an instance of the User class as the security context of this client instance. This user’s signing identity (the private key and its corresponding certificate), will be used to sign all requests with the fabric backend. Upon setting the user context, the SDK saves the object in a persistence cache if the “state store” has been set on the Client instance. If no state store has been set, this cache will not be established and the application is responsible for setting the user context again if the application crashes and is recovered. Parameters: Name Type Description user User An instance of the User class encapsulating the authenticated user’s signing materials (private key and enrollment certificate) skipPersistence boolean Whether to skip saving the user object into persistence. Default is false and the method will attempt to save the user object to the state store. Returns: Promise of the 'user' object upon successful persistence of the user to the state store Type Promise setUserFromConfig(username, password, clear_existing_user) Sets the user context based on the passed in username and password and the organization in the client section of the network configuration settings. Parameters: Name Type Description username string username of the user password string password of the user clear_existing_user boolean to clear out any current user context of this client. The default will be to use the current user if they have the same username. signChannelConfig(config) Channel configuration updates can be sent to the orderers to be processed. The orderer enforces the Channel creation or update policies such that the updates will be made only when enough signatures from participating organizations are discovered in the request. Typically channel creation or update requests must be signed by participating organizations' ADMIN principals, although this policy can be customized when the consortium is defined. This method uses the client instance's current signing identity to sign over the configuration bytes passed in, and returns the signature that is ready to be included in the configuration update protobuf message to send to the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description config Array.&lt;byte&gt; The Configuration Update in byte form Returns: - The signature of the current user on the config bytes Type ConfigSignature updateChannel(request) Calls the orderer to update an existing channel. After the channel updates are successfully processed by the orderer, the orderer cuts a new block containing the new channel configuration and delivers it to all the participating peers in the channel. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the update request by the orderer. A channel update is finally completed when the new channel configuration block created by the orderer has been committed to the channel's peers. To be notified of the successful update of the channel, an application should use the EventHub to connect to the peers and register a block listener.

As a result the applications must design their handling of the transaction lifecyle in an asynchrous fashion. After the transaction proposal has been successfully endorsed, and before the transaction message has been successfully broadcast to the orderer, the application should register a listener to be notified of the event when the transaction achieves finality, which is when the block containing the transaction gets added to the peer's ledger/blockchain. Fabric committing peers provides an event stream to publish events to registered listeners. As of v1.0, the only events that get published are Block events. A Block event gets published whenever the committing peer adds a validated block to the ledger. There are three ways to register a listener to get notified: register a &quot;block listener&quot; to get called for every block event on all channels. The listener will be passed a fully decoded Block object. See registerBlockEvent register a &quot;transaction listener&quot; to get called when the specific transaction by id is committed (discovered inside a block event). The listener will be passed the transaction id and the validation code. See registerTxEvent register a &quot;chaincode event listener&quot; to get called when a specific chaincode event has arrived. The listener will be passed the ChaincodeEvent. See registerChaincodeEvent The events are ephemeral, such that if a registered listener crashed when the event is published, the listener will miss the event. There are several techniques to compensate for missed events due to client crashes: register block event listeners and record the block numbers received, such that when the next block arrives and its number is not the next in sequence, then the application knows exactly which block events have been missed. It can then use queryBlock to get those missed blocks from the target peer. use a message queue to catch all the block events. With many robust message queue implementations available today, you will be guaranteed to not miss an event. A fabric event listener can be written in any programming language. The following implementations can be used as reference to write the necessary glue code between the fabric event stream and a message queue: Node.js: this class. Source code can be found here Java: part of the Java SDK for Hyperledger Fabric. Source code can be found here Golang: an example event listener client can be found here new EventHub(clientContext) Constructs an EventHub object Parameters: Name Type Description clientContext Client An instance of the Client class which has already been initialzed with a userContext. Example var eh = client.newEventHub(); eh.setPeerAddr( 'grpcs://localhost:7053', { pem: Buffer.from(certdata).toString(), 'ssl-target-name-override': 'peer1'] } ); // register the listeners before calling &quot;connect()&quot; so that we can // have the error callback ready to process an error in case the // connect() call fails eh.registerTxEvent( transactionId, (tx, code) =&gt; { eh.unregisterTxEvent(transactionId); console.log(util.format('Transaction %s has completed', transactionId)); }, (err) =&gt; { eh.unregisterTxEvent(transactionId); console.log(util.format('Error %s! Transaction listener for %s has been ' + 'deregistered with %s', transactionId, err, eh.getPeerAddr())); } ); eh.connect(); Methods connect() Establishes a connection with the peer event source. The peer address must be set by calling the setPeerAddr() method before calling this method. The connection will be established asynchronously. If the connection fails to get established, the application will be notified via the error callbacks from the registerXXXEvent() methods. It is recommended that an application always registers at least one event listener with an error callback, by calling any one of the registerBlockEvent, registerTxEvent or registerChaincodeEvent methods, before calling connect(). disconnect() Disconnects the event hub from the peer event source. Will close all event listeners and send an Error object with the message &quot;EventHub has been shutdown&quot; to all listeners that provided an &quot;onError&quot; callback. getPeerAddr() Return the peer url of this event hub object isconnected() Is the event hub connected to the event source? Returns: True if connected to the event source, false otherwise Type boolean registerBlockEvent(onEvent, onError) Register a listener to receive all block events from all the channels that the target peer is part of. The listener's &quot;onEvent&quot; callback gets called on the arrival of every block. If the target peer is expected to participate in more than one channel, then care must be taken in the listener's implementation to differentiate blocks from different channels. See the example below on how to accomplish that. An error may be thrown by this call if no &quot;onError&quot; callback is provided and this EventHub has noticed that the connection has not been established. However since the connection establishment is running asynchronously, a register call could be made before this EventHub has been notified of the network issue. The best practice would be to provide an &quot;onError&quot; callback to be notified when this EventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description onEvent function Callback function that takes a single parameter of a Block object onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. Returns: This is the block registration number that must be sed to unregister (see unregisterBlockEvent) Type int Example Find out the channel Id of the arriving block eh.registerBlockEvent( (block) =&gt; { var first_tx = block.data.data[0]; // get the first transaction var header = first_tx.payload.header; // the &quot;header&quot; object contains metadata of the transaction var channel_id = header.channel_header.channel_id; if (&quot;mychannel&quot; !== channel_id) return; // do useful processing of the block }, (err) =&gt; { console.log('Oh snap!'); } ); registerChaincodeEvent(ccid, eventname, onEvent, onError) Register a listener to receive chaincode events. An error may be thrown by this call if no &quot;onError&quot; callback is provided and this EventHub has noticed that the connection has not been established. However since the connection establishment is running asynchronously, a register call could be made before this EventHub has been notified of the network issue. The best practice would be to provide an &quot;onError&quot; callback to be notified when this EventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description ccid string Id of the chaincode of interest eventname string The exact name of the chaincode event (must match the name given to the target chaincode's call to stub.SetEvent(name, payload)), or a regex string to match more than one event by this chaincode onEvent function callback function for matched events. It gets passed a single parameter which is a ChaincodeEvent object onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. Returns: An object that should be treated as an opaque handle used to unregister (see unregisterChaincodeEvent) Type Object registerTxEvent(txid, onEvent, onError) Register a callback function to receive a notification when the transaction by the given id has been committed into a block. An error may be thrown by this call if no &quot;onError&quot; callback is provided and this EventHub has noticed that the connection has not been established. However since the connection establishment is running asynchronously, a register call could be made before this EventHub has been notified of the network issue.

Parameters: Name Type Description txid string Transaction id string onEvent function Callback function that takes a parameter of type Transaction, and a string parameter which indicates if the transaction is valid (code = 'VALID'), or not (code string indicating the reason for invalid transaction) onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. setPeerAddr(peeraddr, opts) Set peer event source url.

The ECert must have been signed by one of the CAs the blockchain network has been configured to trust. An enrolled user (having a signing key and ECert) can conduct chaincode instantiate, transactions and queries with the Channel. User ECerts can be obtained from a CA beforehand as part of installing and instantiating the application, or it can be obtained from the optional Fabric CA service via its enrollment process. Sometimes User identities are confused with Peer identities. User identities represent signing capability because it has access to the private key, while Peer identities in the context of the application/SDK only has the certificate for verifying signatures. An application cannot use the Peer identity to sign things because the application doesn’t have access to the Peer identity’s private key. new User(cfg) Constructor for a member.

At a high level, a business application running on a Hyperledger Fabric network is made up of two parts: chaincode that runs in the servers (endorser nodes), and client code that runs in the Node.js application. For chaincode development, please visit the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode tutorials. For complete information on starting a Hyperledger Fabric network, please see the Build your first network tutorial. The following tutorial assumes a chaincode has been developed and the focus is developing the client application. What makes up a Hyperledger Fabric application development environment?Below you'll find a high level summary of the Hyperledger Fabric design aimed at an introductory level of understanding, so that you can be on your way to setting up the development environment. For a comprehensive description of the concepts, the architecture, please visit the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation. First of all, you will need an orderer. But isn't an orderer responsible for the consensus? Why start here? It's true that the main responsibility of the ordering service of a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is to provide consensus on a transaction among the maintainers of the ledger, a.k.a the committer nodes. However, the ordering service also maintains critical data about the overall network: what organizations are participating, what channels have been created, which organizations are part of a given channel, and last but not least what policies are in place for any kind of change to the network. In essence, the ordering service holds the network together. Ok we've got to have an orderer node so we can add participating organizations to it and get a network started. Next you would need peers for each participating organization in order to participate in transaction endorsing and maintaining the ledger. The peer nodes play two roles: endorser and committer. A peer's endorser role may be enabled or disabled based on the bootstrap configuration. Note that all peers are always committers. For high availability you would want more than one peer for each organization in a real deployment. For the development environment, one peer per organization is sufficient under most circumstances. This peer will be both an endorser and a committer. It will be sent transaction proposals to endorse and queries to discover information from the ledger. Another important role that peer nodes play is broadcasting events to interested parties. Whenever a block is added to the ledger, an event is sent by the peer through a dedicated streaming port. Any application within the organization can register themselves to listen on that port to get notified. The final piece of the puzzle is identities. Every operation in a Hyperledger Fabric network must be digitially signed for the purposes of access control, or provenance/auditing (who did what), or both. As of v1.0, identities are based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)) standards. Every orderer node, every peer node and every user/transactor must have a key pair with the public key wrapped in a x.509 certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). Since x.509 is an open standard, Hyperledger Fabric would work with any existing certificate authority. This is typically a painful process with lots of potential red tape to get real certificates, so for the development purposes it is a popular practice to use self-signed certificates locally generated. As you will see in the later section, the Hyperledger Fabric provides tools to make this less painful. Also related to identities, you should make a decision on whether Fabric-CA should be part of your solution. This is a server with REST APIs that supports dynamic identity management with registration, enrollment (getting certificates), revocation and re-enrollment. So it is very useful in providing user identities on the fly. Note that user identities provisioned this way are only of the MEMBER role, which means it won't be able to perform certain operations reserved for the ADMIN role: create/update channel install/instantiate chaincode query installed/instantiated chaincodes For these privileged operations, the client must use an ADMIN user to submit the request. If you choose to not use Fabric-CA, everything will still work, but the application is responsible for managing the user certificates. PrerequisitesYou will need the following software: Docker and Docker Compose - see Hyperledger Fabric for details Nodejs v6.2.0 - 6.10.0, 8.4.0+ ( Node v7+ is not supported ) Prepare crypto materialsAs discussed above, identities are established with x.509 certificates. If you think about it, we will need a whole bunch of certificates because there are many identities involved: peers need identities to sign endorsements orderers need identities to sign proposed blocks for the committers to validate and append to the ledger applications need identities to sign transaction requests the Fabric CA themselves also need identities, so their signatures in the certificates can be validated Luckily there is a tool for that. Follow this guide to use the cryptogen tool to generate all the required keys and certificates in one swoop. Note that the cryptogen tool will automatically generate identities for the Fabric CA nodes for each orderer and peer organization, which can be used to start the Fabric-CA servers (if you choose to use it as part of the solution as discussed above). In addition, it also generates one admin user of the ADMIN role with the privileges to perform admin-level operations listed above. Finally, it also generates regular users (MEMBER role) for submitting transactions. This would get us all the crypto materials needed to start things up. Getting things rolling for real - the genesis blockAs discussed above, the orderer should be the first step to bootstrap (launch) a network. The orderer will need the initial configurations wrapped inside a genesis block. Follow the instructions here to use the congigtxgen tool to generate a genesis.block. The output, a genesis block file for the orderer, will be used in the next step to launch the orderer node. Start the networkNow we are ready to put it all together. The easiest way to launch the development environment is to use docker-compose. Follow the instructions here to start the network. To minimize the chances of a mistake, you may wish to run the network without TLS. The above steps give you a development environment. Now before you can ask it to process any transactions, you must first create a channel.

It shows how to use an initial (default) channel definition and how to start with that definition to build a custom definition. The process to create a network and channels also involves creating and working with cryptographic material, this will not be discussed here. For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration cryptographic generation see cryptogen configuration transaction generator see configtxgen configuration translation tool see configtxlator The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), protobuf, and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. The examples shown below are based on the balance-transfer sample application. see Hyperledger Fabric Samples steps of a channel create: run the configtxgen tool to generate a genesis block run the configtxgen tool to generate an initial binary configuration definition get a sign-able channel definition in one of two ways use the initial binary channel configuration definition use the fabric-client SDK to extract the sign-able channel definition from the initial binary channel configuration definition build a custom definition use the configtxlator to convert the initial binary channel configuration definition to readable text edit the readable text more info use the configtxlator to convert the edited text to a sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to sign the sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to send the signatures and the sign-able channel definition to the orderer use the fabric-client SDK to have the peer join the channel then new channel may be used Use the initial definition to build a sign-able channel definitionThe initial binary channel configuration definition generated by the configtxgen tool is a binary file containing the Hyperledger Fabric configuration protobuf common.Envelope element. Inside this element is the common.ConfigUpdate protobuf element. This configuration element is the one that must be signed. A profile element in the configtx.yaml is the source for the initial binary channel configuration definition created by the configtxgen tool. ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannelHave the fabric-client SDK extract the config update element from the mychannel.tx file // first read in the file, this gives us a binary config envelope let envelope_bytes = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel/mychannel.tx')); // have the nodeSDK extract out the config update var config_update = client.extractChannelConfig(envelope_bytes);The binary config_update may now be used in the signing process and sent to the orderer for channel creation. You may ask why is a common.ConfigUpdate used for a create. This makes the process of create and update the same. The create of a new channel is a delta on what is defined in the system channel and an update is a delta on what is defined in the channel. The common.ConfigUpdate object submitted will only contain the changes for both a create and an update. Creating a custom sign-able channel definitionThe easiest way to get started with creating a custom channel configuration is to have the configtxlator convert an existing binary that has been or could be used to create a new channel to human readable JSON. There are many elements of the configuration and it would be very difficult to start with nothing. Using the same configtx.yaml file used to generate your Hyperledger Fabric network, use the configtxgen tool to create a initial binary configuration definition for a new channel. Then by sending that binary to the configtxlator to convert it to JSON, you will be able to see the layout and have a starting point. That JSON could also be used as a template for creating other new channels on your network. A new channel will inherit settings from the system channel for settings not defined in the new channel configuration. Organizations that will be on the new channel must be defined in a consortium on the system channel. Therefore having the readable definition of the system channel of your network would be helpful when creating a new channel. Send the genesis.block that was used to start the Hyperledger Fabric network to the configtxlator to get a JSON file to be used as a reference. Use the configtxgen tool to produce the binary config files. From the sample directory fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel. export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD ../../../bin/configtxgen -outputBlock genesis.block -profile TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannel Send the two binary files to the configtxlator service. Since this step is done only once and does not require a Node.js application, we will use cURL to simplify and speed up getting the results. Notice that configtxlator service path has decode (convert from binary to JSON). The path must also include the type of object of the binary, in the first case, it is a common.Block. The &quot;decode&quot; or &quot;encode&quot; may be done for any of the protobuf message object types found in the fabric-client\\lib\\protos directory protobuf files. First start the configtxlator service, from the fabric-samples/bin directory ./configtxlator startThen curl -X POST --data-binary @genesis.block http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Block &gt; genesis.json curl -X POST --data-binary @mychannel.tx http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Envelope &gt; mychannel.jsonThe results of decoding the file mychannel.tx which is a common.Envelope produced by the configtxgen tool contains a common.ConfigUpdate object. This object has the name &quot;config_update&quot; within the &quot;payload.data&quot; JSON object. This is the object that is needed as the source of the template to be used for creating new channels. The common.ConfigUpdate is the object that will be signed by all organizations and submitted to the orderer to create a new channel. The following is the extracted JSON &quot;config_update&quot; (common.ConfigUpdate) object from the decode of the &quot;TwoOrgsChannel&quot; channel create binary generated above. { &quot;channel_id&quot;: &quot;mychannel&quot;, &quot;read_set&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Application&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Org1MSP&quot;: {} } } }, &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;Consortium&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SampleConsortium&quot; } } } }, &quot;write_set&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Application&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Org1MSP&quot;: {} }, &quot;mod_policy&quot;: &quot;Admins&quot;, &quot;policies&quot;: { &quot;Admins&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;rule&quot;: &quot;MAJORITY&quot;, &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Admins&quot; } } }, &quot;Readers&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Readers&quot; } } }, &quot;Writers&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Writers&quot; } } } }, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1&quot; } }, &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;Consortium&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SampleConsortium&quot; } } } } }Note that the Consortium name used must exist on the system channel. All organizations that you wish to add to the new channel must be defined under in the Consortium section with that name on the system channel. Use the decoded genesis block to verify all values, for example by looking in the genesis.json file generated above. To add an organizations to the channel, they must be placed under the groups section under the Applications section as shown above. See that Org1MSP is a property of Applications.groups section. In this example all of the settings for the organization Org1MSP will be inherited from the system channel (notice the empty object &quot;{}&quot; for this organization's properties). To see the current settings for this organization look within the SampleConsortium section under the Consortium section of the system channel (the genesis block of the system channel). Once you have a JSON configuration representing your channel, send it the configtxlator to be encoded into a configuration binary. The following example of sending a REST request to the configtxlator uses the Node.js package superagent because of the ease of use for HTTP requests. var response = superagent.post('http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/encode/common.ConfigUpdate', config_json.toString()) .buffer() .end((err, res) =&gt; { if(err) { logger.error(err); return; } config_proto = res.body; });Signing and submitting the channel updateThe binary configuration must be signed by all organizations. The application will have to store the binary configuration and have it available to be signed along with storing all the signatures as it collects them. Then once the signing is complete, the application will send the binary configuration and all the signatures to the orderer using the fabric-client SDK API createChannel(). First the signing, assuming the client fabric-client SDK object has a valid user in a required organization var signature = client.signChannelConfig(config_proto); signatures.push(signature);Now it is time for the channel create, assuming that the signatures object is an array of common.ConfigSignature returned by the client.signChannelConfig() method. Note: The orderer must be started with the genesis.block that was generated from the same configuration file as the initial binary channel configuration definition // create an orderer object to represent the orderer of the network var orderer = client.newOrderer(url,opts); // have the SDK generate a transaction id let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); request = { config: config_proto, //the binary config signatures : signatures, // the collected signatures name : 'mychannel', // the channel name orderer : orderer, //the orderer from above txId : tx_id //the generated transaction id }; // this call will return a Promise client.createChannel(request)The createChannel API returns a Promise to return the status of the submit. The channel create will take place asynchronously by the orderer. After a small delay of a few seconds the channel will have been created by the orderer and may now be joined by the peers. Issue the following to the peers that are required on the channel. This is a two step process of first getting the genesis block of the channel and then sending it to the peer. In the following example the genesis block was retrieved from the orderer, but could have also been loaded from a file. // set the channel up with network endpoints var orderer = client.newOrderer(orderer_url,orderer_opts); channel.addOrderer(orderer); var peer = client.newPeer(peer_url,peer_opts); channel.addPeer(peer); tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let g_request = { txId : tx_id }; // get the genesis block from the orderer channel.getGenesisBlock(g_request).then((block) =&gt;{ genesis_block = block; tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let j_request = { targets : targets, block : genesis_block, txId : tx_id }; // send genesis block to the peer return channel.joinChannel(j_request); }).then((results) =&gt;{ if(results &amp;&amp; results.response &amp;&amp; results.response.status == 200) { // join successful } else { // not good } });This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.4 on 2017-09-06T20:00:38+00:00 using the DocStrap template.
