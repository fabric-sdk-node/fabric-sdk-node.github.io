The design allows recursion PolicySpec Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description type Object The type of policy can be &quot;signed-by&quot; for a single identity signature or &quot;n-of&quot; where &quot;n&quot; is a numeric value. If the type property is &quot;signed-by&quot;, the value is the numeric index into the array of identities specified in the policy. If the type property is &quot;n-of&quot;, the value is an array of PolicySpec objects. As you can see, this structure allows recursive definitions of complex policies. ProcessedTransaction Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description validationCode number See this list for all the defined validation codes transactionEnvelope Object Encapsulates the transaction and the signature over it. It has the following structure: signature -- {byte[]} payload -- {} header -- {Header} data -- {Transaction} ProposalRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description fcn string Required. The function name. args Array.&lt;string&gt; Required. Arguments to send to chaincode. chaincodeId string Required. ChaincodeId. argbytes Buffer Optional. Include when an argument must be included as bytes. transientMap map Optional. The Map that can be used by the chaincode but not saved in the ledger, such as cryptographic information for encryption. ProposalResponse A protobuf message that gets returned by endorsing peers on proposal requests. The peer node runs the target chaincode, as designated by the proposal, and decides on whether to endorse the proposal or not, and sends back the endorsement result along with the read and write sets inside the proposal response message. Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description version number timestamp Timestamp Time the proposal was created by the submitter response Response payload Array.&lt;byte&gt; The payload of the response. It is the encoded bytes of the &quot;ProposalResponsePayload&quot; protobuf message endorsement Endorsement The endorsement of the proposal, basically the endorser's signature over the payload ProposalResponseObject All calls to the endorsing peers for proposal endorsement return this standard array of objects. Type: array Properties: Name Type Description index:0 Array.&lt;ProposalResponse&gt; Array of ProposalResponse objects from the endorsing peers index:1 Object The original Proposal object needed when sending the transaction request to the orderer RegistrationOpts Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description startBlock integer Optional - The starting block number for event checking. When included, the peer's channel event service will be asked to start sending blocks from this block number. This is how to resume or replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. Default is the latest block on the ledger. Setting a startBlock may confuse other event listeners, therefore only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when a startBlock is being used. endBlock integer | 'newest' Optional - The ending block number for event checking. The value 'newest' to indicate that endBlock will be calculated by the peer as the newest block on the ledger. This allows the application to replay up to the latest block on the ledger and then the listener will stop and be notified by the 'onError' callback. When included, the peer's channel event service will be asked to stop sending blocks once this block is delivered. This is how to replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. When a startBlock is not included, the endBlock must be equal to or larger the current channel block height. Setting an endBlock may confuse other event listeners, therefore only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when an endBlock is being used. unregister boolean Optional - This options setting indicates the registration should be removed (unregister) when the event is seen. When the application is using a timeout to only wait a specified amount of time for the transaction to be seen, the timeout processing should included the manual 'unregister' of the transaction event listener to avoid the event callbacks being called unexpectedly. The default for this setting is different for the different type of event listeners. For block listeners the default is true, however the event listener is assumed to have seen the final event only if the end_block was set as a option and that end_block was seen by the the listener. For transaction listeners the default is true and the listener will be unregistered when a transaction with the id is seen by this listener. For chaincode listeners the default will be false as the match filter might be intended for many transactions rather than a specific transaction or block as in the other listeners. disconnect boolean Optional - This option setting Indicates to the ChannelEventHub instance to automatically disconnect itself from the peer's channel event service once the event has been seen. The default is false unless the endBlock has been set, then it it will be true. REQUEST_TIMEOUT The Error message string that indicates that the request operation has timed out due to a remote node issue. If there is an issue with the local system a 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error message will be returned. The operation will only use one timer for both types of timeouts. The timer will start running as the operation begins. If the timer expires before the local instance is able to make the outbound request then 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error will be returned. If the local instance is able to make the outbound request and the timer expires before the remote node responds then the 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' is returned. The timer is controlled by the 'request-timeout' setting or passed on a call that makes an outbound request Type: Error Examples 'client.setConfigSetting('request-timeout', 3000)' 'channel.sendTranaction(request, 3000)' Response A response message indicating whether the endorsement of the proposal was successful Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description status number Status code. Follows HTTP status code definitions message string A message associated with the response status code payload Array.&lt;byte&gt; A payload that can be used to include metadata with this response Role Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description name string Name of the role. Value can be &quot;member&quot; or &quot;admin&quot; mspId string The member service provider Id used to process the identity ServiceResponse Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description Success boolean Boolean indicating if the request was successful Result Object The result of this request Errors Array.&lt;ServiceResponseMessage&gt; An array of error messages (code and message) Messages Array.&lt;ServiceResponseMessage&gt; An array of information messages (code and message) ServiceResponseMessage Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description code number Integer code denoting the type of message message string A more specific message SignatureHeader An object that is part of all signatures in Hyperledger Fabric. The &quot;creator&quot; field has two important pieces of information about the identity of the signer, the organization (Mspid) that the signer belongs to, and the certificate (IdBytes). The &quot;nonce&quot; field is a unique value to guard against replay attacks. creator Mspid -- {string} IdBytes -- {byte[]} nonce -- {byte[]} Type: Object SignaturePolicy SignaturePolicy is a recursive message structure which defines a featherweight DSL for describing policies which are more complicated than 'exactly this signature'. The NOutOf operator is sufficent to express AND as well as OR, as well as of course N out of the following M policies. SignedBy implies that the signature is from a valid certificate which is signed by the trusted authority specified in the bytes. This will be the certificate itself for a self-signed certificate and will be the CA for more traditional certificates A &quot;SignaturePolicy&quot; will have the following object structure. type -- SIGNATURE rule Type -- n_out_of n_out_of N -- {int} rules -- {array} Type -- signed_by signed_by -- {int} identities -- {array} principal_classification -- {int} msp_identifier -- {string} Role -- MEMBER | ADMIN Type: Object SignedCommitProposal Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest Required. The commit request signedTransaction Buffer Required. The signed transaction orderer Orderer | string Optional. The orderer instance or string name of the orderer to operate.

The function name. signedProposal Buffer Required. The signed endorse proposal SYSTEM_TIMEOUT The Error message string that indicates that the request operation has timed out due to a system issue. This will indicate that the issue is local rather than remote. If there is an issue with the remote node a 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' error message will be returned. The operation will only use one timer for both types of timeouts. The timer will start running as the operation begins. If the timer expires before the local instance is able to make the outbound request then 'SYSTEM_TIMEOUT' error will be returned. If the local instance is able to make the outbound request and the timer expires before the remote node responds then the 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT' is returned. The timer is controlled by the 'request-timeout' setting or passed on a call that makes an outbound request Type: Error Examples 'client.setConfigSetting('request-timeout', 3000)' 'channel.sendTranaction(request, 3000)' Transaction A Transaction, or &quot;Endorser Transaction&quot;, is the result of invoking chaincodes to collect endorsements, getting globally ordered in the context of a channel, and getting validated by the committer peer as part of a block before finally being formally &quot;committed&quot; to the ledger inside a Block. Each transaction contains an array of &quot;actions&quot; representing different steps for executing a transaction, and those steps will be processed atomically, meaning if any one step failed then the whole transaction will be marked as rejected. Each entry of the &quot;actions&quot; array contains a chaincode proposal and corresponding proposal responses that encapsulate the endorsing peer's decisions on whether the proposal is considered valid. Note that even if a transaction proposal(s) is considered valid by the endorsing peers, it may still be rejected by the committers during transaction validation. Whether a transaction as a whole is valid or not, is not reflected in the transaction record itself, but rather recorded in a separate field in the Block's metadata. A &quot;Transaction&quot; will have the following object structure. actions {array} header -- {SignatureHeader} payload chaincode_proposal_payload input -- {ChaincodeInvocationSpec} for a endorser transaction action proposal_response_payload proposal_hash -- {byte[]} extension results data_model -- {int} ns_rwset -- {array} namespace -- {string} rwset reads -- {array} key -- {string} version block_num -- {number} tx_num -- {number} range_queries_info -- {array} writes -- {array} key -- {string} is_delete -- {boolean} value -- {string} metadata_writes -- {array} key -- {string} entries -- {array} name -- {string} value -- {byte[]} collection_hashed_rwset -- {array} collection_name -- {string} hashed_rwset hashed_reads -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} version block_num -- {number} tx_num -- {number} hashed_writes -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} is_delete -- {boolean} value_hash -- {byte[]} metadata_writes -- {array} key_hash -- {byte[]} entries -- {array} name -- {string} value -- {byte[]} pvt_rwset_hash -- {byte[]} events chaincode_id -- {string} tx_id -- {string} event_name -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} response status -- {int} message -- {string} payload -- {byte[]} endorsements -- {Endorsement[]} Type: Object TransactionRequest Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description proposalResponses Array.&lt;ProposalResponse&gt; An array of or a single ProposalResponse object containing the response from the endorsement call proposal Proposal A Proposal object containing the original request for endorsement(s) txID TransactionId Optional. - Must be the transaction ID object used in the proposal endorsement.

The SDK is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime. OverviewHyperledger Fabric is the operating system of an enterprise-strength permissioned blockchain network. For a high-level overview of the fabric, visit http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Applications can be developed to interact with the blockchain network on behalf of the users. APIs are available to: create channels ask peer nodes to join the channel install chaincodes in peers instantiate chaincodes in a channel invoke transactions by calling the chaincode query the ledger for transactions or blocks How Different Components of the Fabric Work TogetherThe Transaction Flow document provides an excellent description of the application/SDK, peers, and orderers working together to process transactions and producing blocks. Security on the Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrollment certificates. For a user's enrollment certificate to be considered valid on the Fabric, it must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Fabric supports any standard CAs. In addition, Fabric provides a CA server. See this overview. Features of the SDK for Node.jsThe Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js is designed in an Object-Oriented programming style. Its modular construction enables application developers to plug in alternative implementations of key functions such as crypto suites, the state persistence store, and logging utility. The SDK's list of features include: fabric-client: create a new channel send channel information to a peer to join install chaincode on a peer instantiate chaincode in a channel, which involves two steps: propose and transact submitting a transaction, which also involves two steps: propose and transact query a chaincode for the latest application state various query capabilities: channel height block-by-number, block-by-hash all channels that a peer is part of all installed chaincodes in a peer all instantiated chaincodes in a channel transaction-by-id channel configuration data monitoring events: connect to a peer's event stream listen on block events listen on transactions events and find out if the transaction was successfully committed to the ledger or marked invalid listen on custom events produced by chaincodes serializable User object with signing capabilities hierarchical configuration settings with multiple layers of overrides: files, environment variable, program arguments, in-memory settings logging utility with a built-in logger (winston) and can be overriden with a number of popular loggers including log4js and bunyan pluggable CryptoSuite interface describe the cryptographic operations required for successful interactions with the Fabric. Two implementations are provided out of box: Software-based ECDSA PKCS#11-compliant ECDSA pluggable State Store interface for persisting state caches such as users File-based store CouchDB-base store which works with both CouchDB database and IBM Cloudant customizable Crypto Key Store for any software-based cryptographic suite implementation supports both TLS (grpcs://) or non-TLS (grpc://) connections to peers and orderers, see Remote which is the superclass for peers and orderers fabric-ca-client: register a new user enroll a user to obtain the enrollment certificate signed by the Fabric CA revoke an existing user by enrollment ID or revoke a specific certificate customizable persistence store API ReferenceThe SDK is made up of 3 top-level modules that can be accessed through the navigation menu Modules: api: pluggable APIs for application developers to supply alternative implementations of key interfaces used by the SDK. For each interface there are built-in default implementations. fabric-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the core components of a Hypreledger Fabric-based blockchain network, namely the peers, orderers and event streams. fabric-ca-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the optional component, fabric-ca, that contains services for membership management.

Unless this method is called, the SDK uses a default logger based on winston. When using the built-in winston based logger, use the configuration setting hfc-logging to pass in configurations in the following format: { 'error': 'error.log', // 'error' logs are printed to file 'error.log' relative of the current working dir for node.js 'debug': '/tmp/myapp/debug.log', // 'debug' and anything more critical ('info', 'warn', 'error') can also be an absolute path 'info': 'console' // 'console' is a keyword for logging to console } Parameters: Name Type Description logger Object a logger instance that defines the following methods: debug(), info(), warn(), error() with string interpolation methods like util.format. getCryptoSuite() Returns the CryptoSuite object used by this client instance Returns: Type module:api.CryptoSuite setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) Sets the client instance to use the CryptoSuite object for signing and hashing Creating and setting a CryptoSuite is optional because the client will construct an instance based on default configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one.

A Channel object captures the settings needed to interact with a fabric backend in the context of a channel. These settings including the list of participating organizations, represented by instances of Membership Service Providers (MSP), the list of endorsing peers, and an orderer. A client application can use the Channel object to create new channels with the orderer, update an existing channel, send various channel-aware requests to the peers such as invoking chaincodes to process transactions or queries. A Channel object is also responsible for verifying endorsement signatures in transaction proposal responses. A channel object must be initialized after it has been configured with the list of peers and orderers. The initialization sends a get configuration block request to the primary orderer to retrieve the configuration settings for this channel. new Channel(name, clientContext) Returns a new instance of the class. This is a client-side-only call. To create a new channel in the fabric, call createChannel(). Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name to identify the channel. This value is used as the identifier of the channel when making channel-aware requests with the fabric, such as invoking chaincodes to endorse transactions. The naming of channels is enforced by the ordering service and must be unique within the fabric backend. Channel name in fabric network is subject to a pattern revealed in the configuration setting channel-name-regx-checker. clientContext Client The client instance, which provides operational context such as the signing identity Methods &lt;async, static&gt; sendSignedProposal(request, timeout) Send signed transaction proposal to peer Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedProposal signed endorse transaction proposal, this signed proposal would be send to peer directly. timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; _discover(request) Send a request to a known peer to discover information about the fabric network. Parameters: Name Type Description request DiscoveryRequest - Returns: The results from the discovery service Type DiscoveryResponse addOrderer(orderer, replace) Add the orderer object to the channel object, this is a client-side-only operation. An application may add more than one orderer object to the channel object, however the SDK only uses the first one in the list to send broadcast messages to the orderer backend. Parameters: Name Type Description orderer Orderer An instance of the Orderer class. replace boolean If an orderer exist with the same name, replace with this one. addPeer(peer, mspid, roles, replace) Add the peer object to the channel object. A channel object can be optionally configured with a list of peer objects, which will be used when calling certain methods such as sendInstantiateProposal(), sendUpgradeProposal(), sendTransactionProposal. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class that has been initialized with URL and other gRPC options such as TLS credentials and request timeout. mspid string The mpsid of the organization this peer belongs. roles ChannelPeerRoles Optional. The roles this peer will perform on this channel. A role that is not defined will default to true replace boolean If an orderer exist with the same name, replace with this one. close() Close the service connections of all assigned peers and orderers compareProposalResponseResults(The) Utility method to examine a set of proposals to check they contain the same endorsement result write sets. This will validate that the endorsing peers all agree on the result of the chaincode execution. Parameters: Name Type Description The Array.&lt;ProposalResponse&gt; proposal responses from all endorsing peers Returns: True when all proposals compare equally, false otherwise. Type boolean generateUnsignedProposal(request, mspId, certificate, admin) Generates the endorse proposal bytes for a transaction Current the sendTransactionProposal sign a transaction using the user identity from SDK's context (which contains the user's private key). This method is designed to build the proposal bytes at SDK side, and user can sign this proposal with their private key, and send the signed proposal to peer by [sendSignedProposal] so the user's private key would not be required at SDK side. Parameters: Name Type Description request ProposalRequest chaincode invoke request mspId string the mspId for this identity certificate string PEM encoded certificate admin boolean if this transaction is invoked by admin Returns: Type Proposal &lt;async&gt; generateUnsignedTransaction(request) generate the commit proposal for a transaction Parameters: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest &lt;async&gt; getChannelConfig(target, timeout) Asks the peer for the current (latest) configuration block for this channel. Parameters: Name Type Description target string | Peer Optional. The peer to be used to make the request. timeout Number Optional. A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error.

The channel's MSPs are critical in providing applications the ability to validate certificates and verify signatures in messages received from the fabric backend. For instance, after calling sendTransactionProposal(), the application can verify the signatures in the proposal response's endorsements to ensure they have not been tampered with. This method retrieves the configuration from the orderer if no &quot;config&quot; parameter is passed in. Optionally a configuration may be passed in to initialize this channel without making the call to the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description request InitializeRequest Optional. a InitializeRequest Returns: A Promise that will resolve when the action is complete Type Promise joinChannel(request, timeout) For a peer node to become part of a channel, it must be sent the genesis block, as explained here.

Returns: A Promise for a Block matching the tx_id, fully decoded into an object. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; queryByChaincode(request, useAdmin) Sends a proposal to one or more endorsing peers that will be handled by the chaincode. There is no difference in how the endorsing peers process a request to invoke a chaincode for transaction vs. to invoke a chaincode for query. All requests will be presented to the target chaincode's 'Invoke' method which must be implemented to understand from the arguments that this is a query request. The chaincode must also return results in the byte array format and the caller will have to be able to decode these results.

Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer An instance of the Peer class. sendInstantiateProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode instantiate proposal to one or more endorsing peers. A chaincode must be instantiated on a channel-by-channel basis before it can be used. The chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run, by calling client.installChaincode(). Instantiating a chaincode is a full transaction operation, meaning it must be first endorsed as a proposal, then the endorsements are sent to the orderer to be processed for ordering and validation. When the transaction finally gets committed to the channel's ledger on the peers, the chaincode is then considered activated and the peers are ready to take requests to process transactions. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise &lt;async&gt; sendSignedProposal(request, timeout) Send signed transaction proposal to peer Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedProposal signed endorse transaction proposal, this signed proposal would be send to peer directly. timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; sendSignedTransaction(request, timeout) send the signed commit proposal for a transaction Parameters: Name Type Description request SignedCommitProposal the signed commit proposal timeout number the timeout setting passed on sendSignedProposal &lt;async&gt; sendTransaction(request, timeout) Send the proposal responses that contain the endorsements of a transaction proposal to the orderer for further processing. This is the 2nd phase of the transaction lifecycle in the fabric. The orderer will globally order the transactions in the context of this channel and deliver the resulting blocks to the committing peers for validation against the chaincode's endorsement policy. When the committering peers successfully validate the transactions, it will mark the transaction as valid inside the block. After all transactions in a block have been validated, and marked either as valid or invalid (with a reason code), the block will be appended (committed) to the channel's ledger on the peer. The caller of this method must use the proposal responses returned from the endorser along with the original proposal that was sent to the endorser. Both of these objects are contained in the ProposalResponseObject returned by calls to any of the following methods: installChaincode() sendInstantiateProposal() sendUpgradeProposal() sendTransactionProposal() Parameters: Name Type Description request TransactionRequest TransactionRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Orderer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a &quot;BroadcastResponse&quot; message returned by the orderer that contains a single &quot;status&quot; field for a standard HTTP response code. This will be an acknowledgement from the orderer of a successfully submitted transaction. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; sendTransactionProposal(request, timeout) Sends a transaction proposal to one or more endorsing peers. After a chaincode gets installed and instantiated, it's ready to take endorsement proposals and participating in transaction processing. A chaincode transaction starts with a proposal that gets sent to the endorsing peers, which executes the target chaincode and decides whether the proposal should be endorsed (if it executes successfully) or not (if the chaincode returns an error). Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInvokeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise sendUpgradeProposal(request, timeout) Sends a chaincode upgrade proposal to one or more endorsing peers. Upgrading a chaincode involves steps similar to instantiating a chaincode. The new chaincode must first be installed on the endorsing peers where this chaincode is expected to run. Similar to instantiating a chaincode, upgrading chaincodes is also a full transaction operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstantiateUpgradeRequest timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for the ProposalResponseObject Type Promise setMSPManager(msp_manager) Set the MSP Manager for this channel.

As a result the applications must design their handling of the transaction lifecycle in an asynchronous fashion. After the transaction proposal has been successfully endorsed, and before the transaction message has been successfully broadcast to the orderer, the application should register a listener to be notified of the event when the transaction achieves finality, which is when the block containing the transaction gets added to the peer's ledger/blockchain. Fabric committing peers provides an event stream to publish blocks to registered listeners. A Block gets published whenever the committing peer adds a validated block to the ledger. There are three ways to register a listener to get notified: register a &quot;block listener&quot; to get called for every block event. The listener will be passed a fully decoded Block object. See registerBlockEvent register a &quot;transaction listener&quot; to get called when the specific transaction by id is committed (discovered inside a published block). The listener will be passed the transaction id, transaction status and block number. See registerTxEvent register a &quot;chaincode event listener&quot; to get called when a specific chaincode event has arrived. The listener will be passed the ChaincodeEvent, block number, transaction id, and transaction status. See registerChaincodeEvent The events are ephemeral, such that if a registered listener crashed when the event is published, the listener will miss the event. There are several techniques to compensate for missed events due to client crashes: register block event listeners and record the block numbers received, such that when the next block arrives and its number is not the next in sequence, then the application knows exactly which block events have been missed. It can then use queryBlock to get those missed blocks from the target peer or register for events using the startBlock option to resume or replay the events. You may also include an endBlock number if you wish to stop listening. use a message queue to catch all the block events. With many robust message queue implementations available today, you will be guaranteed to not miss an event. A fabric event listener can be written in any programming language. The following implementations can be used as reference to write the necessary glue code between the fabric event stream and a message queue: new ChannelEventHub(channel, peer) Constructs a ChannelEventHub object Parameters: Name Type Description channel Channel An instance of the Channel class were this event hub will receive blocks from peer Peer An instance of the Peer class this event hub connects to. Example const eh = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer); // register the listeners before calling &quot;connect()&quot; so there // is an error callback ready to process an error in case the // connect() call fails eh.registerTxEvent( transactionId, (tx, code) =&gt; { eh.unregisterTxEvent(transactionId); console.log(util.format('Transaction %s has completed', transactionId)); }, (err) =&gt; { eh.unregisterTxEvent(transactionId); console.log(util.format('Error %s! Transaction listener for %s has been ' + 'deregistered with %s', transactionId, err, eh.getPeerAddr())); } ); eh.connect(); Methods _sendSignedRegistration() Internal method Send a signed event registration to the peer's eventhub _validateSignedEvent(signedEvent) Internal method validate the signedEvent has signature and payload and return the signedEvent Parameters: Name Type Description signedEvent SignedEvent the signed event to be send to peer checkConnection(force_reconnect) Returns if the stream is ready. and will attempt a restart when forced Parameters: Name Type Description force_reconnect boolean attempt to reconnect if the stream is not in the 'READY' state close() Disconnects the event hub from the peer event source. Will close all event listeners and send an Error object with the message &quot;ChannelEventHub has been shutdown&quot; to all listeners that provided an &quot;onError&quot; callback. connect(options) Establishes a connection with the peer event source. The connection will be established asynchronously. If the connection fails to get established, the application will be notified via the error callbacks from the registerXXXEvent() methods. It is recommended that an application always registers at least one event listener with an error callback, by calling any one of the registerBlockEvent, registerTxEvent or registerChaincodeEvent methods, before calling connect(). Parameters: Name Type Description options ConnectOptions | boolean Optional disconnect() Disconnects the event hub from the peer event source. Will close all event listeners and send an Error object with the message &quot;ChannelEventHub has been shutdown&quot; to all listeners that provided an &quot;onError&quot; callback. generateUnsignedRegistration(options) generate the unsigned eventhub registration, the returned payload should be signed by the identity's private key. Parameters: Name Type Description options EventHubRegistrationRequest the options for register the eventhub at peer, Notice the options should contain either both identity and txId, or both certificate or mspId Returns: the byte array contains the registration payload Type Buffer getName() Return the name of this channel event hub, will be the name of the peer associated with this channel event hub. getPeerAddr() Return the peer url of this event hub object isconnected() Is the event hub connected to the event source? Returns: True if connected to the event source, false otherwise Type boolean registerBlockEvent(onEvent, onError, options) Register a listener to receive all block events from all the channels that the target peer is part of. The listener's &quot;onEvent&quot; callback gets called on the arrival of every block. If the target peer is expected to participate in more than one channel, then care must be taken in the listener's implementation to differentiate blocks from different channels. See the example below on how to accomplish that. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an &quot;onError&quot; callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description onEvent function Callback function that takes a single parameter of a Block object onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. This callback will also be called when the event hub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts - Returns: This is the block registration number that must be sed to unregister (see unregisterBlockEvent) Type int Example Find out the channel Id of the arriving block eh.registerBlockEvent( (block) =&gt; { let first_tx = block.data.data[0]; // get the first transaction let header = first_tx.payload.header; // the &quot;header&quot; object contains metadata of the transaction let channel_id = header.channel_header.channel_id; if (&quot;mychannel&quot; !== channel_id) return; // do useful processing of the block }, (err) =&gt; { console.log('Oh snap!'); } ); registerChaincodeEvent(ccid, eventname, onEvent, onError, options) Register a listener to receive chaincode events. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an &quot;onError&quot; callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description ccid string Id of the chaincode of interest eventname string | RegExp The exact name of the chaincode event (must match the name given to the target chaincode's call to stub.SetEvent(name, payload)), or a regular expression string to match more than one event by this chaincode. onEvent function callback function for matched events. It gets passed four parameters, a ChaincodeEvent object, the block number this transaction was committed to the ledger, the transaction ID, and a string representing the status of the transaction. onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. This callback will also be called when the event hub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts - Returns: An object that should be treated as an opaque handle used to unregister (see unregisterChaincodeEvent) Type Object registerTxEvent(txid, onEvent, onError, options) Register a callback function to receive a notification when the transaction by the given id has been committed into a block. An error may occur in the connection establishment which runs asynchronously. The best practice would be to provide an &quot;onError&quot; callback to be notified when this ChannelEventHub has an issue. Parameters: Name Type Description txid string Transaction id string onEvent function Callback function that takes a parameter of transaction ID, a string parameter indicating the transaction status, and the block number this transaction was committed to the ledger onError function Optional callback function to be notified when this event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a network error or by a call to the &quot;disconnect()&quot; method or a connection error. This callback will also be called when the event hub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying and requesting the endBlock to be 'newest'. options RegistrationOpts - Returns: The transaction ID that was used to register this event listener, will the same as the txid parameter and must be used to unregister this event listener. Type string unregisterBlockEvent(block_registration_number, throwError) Unregister the block event listener using the block registration number that is returned by the call to the registerBlockEvent() method. Parameters: Name Type Description block_registration_number int The block registration number that was returned during registration. throwError boolean Optional - throw an error if the block registration does not exist, default is to not throw an error unregisterChaincodeEvent(listener_handle, throwError) Unregister the chaincode event listener represented by the listener_handle object returned by the registerChaincodeEvent() method Parameters: Name Type Description listener_handle Object The handle object returned from the call to registerChaincodeEvent. throwError boolean Optional - throw an error if the chaincode event registration does not exist, default is to not throw an error unregisterTxEvent(txid, throwError) Unregister transaction event listener for the transaction id.

An application using the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of the Client. An important aspect of the current design of the Client class is that it is stateful. An instance must be configured with a userContext before it can be used to talk to the fabric backend. A userContext is an instance of the User class, which encapsulates the ability to sign requests. If the SDK is used in a multi-user environment, there are two recommended techniques to manage the authenticated users and instances of clients. Use a dedicated client instance per authenticated user. Create a new instance for each authenticated user. You can enroll each authenticated user separately so that each user gets its own signing identity. Use a shared client instance and a common signing identity among authenticated users. It is important to understand that switching userContexts with the same client instance is considered an anti-pattern. This is the direct result of the stateful design. A JIRA work item has been opened to discuss adding support for stateless usage of the SDK: FAB-4563 The client also supports persistence via a stateStore. A state store is a simple storage plugin that implements the module:api.KeyValueStore interface, which helps the SDK save critical information to be used across server restarts/crashes. Out of the box, the SDK saves the signing identities (instances of the User class) in the state store. new Client() Extends BaseClient Methods &lt;static&gt; loadFromConfig(config) Load a network configuration object or load a JSON file and return a Client object. Parameters: Name Type Description config object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file Returns: An instance of this class initialized with the network end points. Type Client &lt;async&gt; _setUserFromConfig(opts) Utility Method Sets the user context based on the passed in username and password and the organization in the client section of the network configuration settings. Parameters: Name Type Description opts Object contains - username [required] - username of the user - password [optional] - password of the user - caName [optional] - name of the Certificate Authority addTlsClientCertAndKey(opts) Utility method to add the mutual tls client material to a set of options. If the tls client material has not been set for the client, it will be generated if the user has been assigned to this client. Note that it will always use the default software cryptosuite, not the one assigned to the client. Parameters: Name Type Description opts object The options object holding the connection settings that will be updated with the mutual TLS clientCert and clientKey. Throws: Will throw an error if generating the tls client material fails createChannel(request) Calls the orderer to start building the new channel. A channel typically has more than one participating organizations. To create a new channel, one of the participating organizations should call this method to submit the creation request to the orderer service. Once the channel is successfully created by the orderer, the next step is to have each organization's peer nodes join the channel, by sending the channel configuration to each of the peer nodes. The step is accomplished by calling the joinChannel() method. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the create request by the orderer. Note that this is not the confirmation of successful creation of the channel. The client application must poll the orderer to discover whether the channel has been created completely or not. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; createUser(opts) Returns a User object with signing identities based on the private key and the corresponding x509 certificate. This allows applications to use pre-existing crypto materials (private keys and certificates) to construct user objects with signing capabilities, as an alternative to dynamically enrolling users with fabric-ca Note that upon successful creation of the new user object, it is set to the client instance as the current userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description opts UserOpts Essential information about the user Returns: Promise for the user object. Type Promise extractChannelConfig(config_envelope) Extracts the protobuf 'ConfigUpdate' object out of the 'ConfigEnvelope' object that is produced by the configtxgen tool. The returned object may then be signed using the signChannelConfig() method of this class. Once the all signatures have been collected, the 'ConfigUpdate' object and the signatures may be used on the createChannel() or updateChannel() calls. Parameters: Name Type Description config_envelope Array.&lt;byte&gt; The encoded bytes of the ConfigEnvelope protobuf Returns: The encoded bytes of the ConfigUpdate protobuf, ready to be signed Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getCertificateAuthority(name) Returns a CertificateAuthority implementation as defined by the settings in the currently loaded network configuration and the client configuration. A network configuration must be loaded for this get method to return a Certificate Authority. A crypto suite must be assigned to this client instance. Running the 'initCredentialStores' method will build the stores and create a crypto suite as defined in the network configuration. Parameters: Name Type Description name string Optional - the name of the Certificate Authority defined in the loaded connection profile. Returns: Type CertificateAuthority getChannel(name, throwError) Get a Channel instance from the client instance. This is a memory-only lookup. If the loaded network configuration has a channel by the 'name', a new channel instance will be created and populated with Orderer objects and Peer objects as defined in the network configuration. Parameters: Name Type Default Description name string Optional. The name of the channel. When omitted the first channel defined in the loaded network configuration will be returned throwError boolean true Indicates if this method will throw an error if the channel is not found. Default is true. Returns: The channel instance Type Channel getClientCertHash(create) Get the client certificate hash Parameters: Name Type Description create boolean Optional. Create the hash based on the current user if the cleint cert has not been assigned to this client Returns: The hash of the client certificate Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getClientConfig() Returns the &quot;client&quot; section of the network configuration. Returns: The client section from the configuration Type object getCryptoSuite() Returns the CryptoSuite object used by this client instance Inherited From: BaseClient#getCryptoSuite Returns: Type module:api.CryptoSuite getMspid() Returns the mspid of the client. The mspid is also used as the reference to the organization. Returns: the mspid of the organization defined in the client section of the loaded network configuration Type string getOrderer(name) This method will create the Orderer if it does not exist and hold a reference to the instance object by name. This method is only able to create an instance of an orderer if there is a loaded connection profile that contains an orderer with the name. Orderers that have been created by the newOrderer method may be reference by the url if no name was provided in the options. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name or url of the orderer Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer getPeer(name) This method will create a Peer instance. This method is only able to create an instance of a peer if there is a loaded connection profile that contains a peer with the name. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the peer Returns: The Peer instance. Type Peer getPeersForOrg(mspid) Returns a list of Peer for the mspid of an organization as defined in the currently loaded network configuration. If no id is provided then the organization named in the currently active network configuration's client section will be used. Parameters: Name Type Description mspid string Optional - The mspid of an organization Returns: An array of Peer instances that are defined for this organization Type Array.&lt;Peer&gt; getStateStore() A convenience method for obtaining the state store object in use by this client. Returns: The KeyValueStore implementation object set on this Client, or null if one has not been set. Type module:api.KeyValueStore &lt;async&gt; getUserContext(name, checkPersistence) Returns the user by the given name. This can be a synchronous call or asynchronous call, depending on whether &quot;checkPersistent&quot; is truthy or not. If truthy, the method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, otherwise it's synchronous. As explained above, the client instance can have an optional state store. The SDK saves enrolled users in the storage which can be accessed by authorized users of the application (authentication is done by the application outside of the SDK). This function attempts to load the user by name from the local storage (via the KeyValueStore interface). The loaded user object must represent an enrolled user with a valid enrollment certificate signed by a trusted CA (such as the CA server). Parameters: Name Type Description name string Optional. If not specified, will only return the current in-memory user context object, or null if none has been set. If &quot;name&quot; is specified, will also attempt to load it from the state store if search in memory failed. checkPersistence boolean Optional. If specified and truthy, the method returns a Promise and will attempt to check the state store for the requested user by the &quot;name&quot;. If not specified or falsey, the method is synchronous and returns the requested user from memory Returns: Promise for the user object corresponding to the name, or null if the user does not exist or if the state store has not been set. Type Promise.&lt;User&gt; &lt;async&gt; initCredentialStores() Sets the state and crypto suite for use by this client. This requires that a network config has been loaded. Will use the settings from the network configuration along with the system configuration to build instances of the stores and assign them to this client and the crypto suites if needed. Returns: - A promise to build a key value store and crypto store. Type Promise &lt;async&gt; installChaincode(request, timeout) A chaincode must be installed to peers and instantiated on a channel before it can be called to process transactions. Chaincode installation is simply uploading the chaincode source and dependencies to the peers. This operation is &quot;channel-agnostic&quot; and is performed on a peer-by-peer basis. Only the peer organization's ADMIN identities are allowed to perform this operation. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChaincodeInstallRequest The request object timeout Number A number indicating milliseconds to wait on the response before rejecting the promise with a timeout error. This overrides the default timeout of the Peer instance and the global timeout in the config settings. Returns: A Promise for a ProposalResponseObject Type Promise isDevMode() Determine if the fabric backend is started in development mode. In development mode, the endorsing peers will not attempt to spin up a docker instance to run the target chaincode requested by a transaction proposal, but instead redirect the invocation requests to the chaincode process that has registered itself with the endorsing peer. This makes it easier to test changes to the chaincode during chaincode development. The client instance can be set to dev mode to reflect the backend's development mode. This will cause the SDK to make adjustments in certain behaviors such as not sending the chaincode package to the peers during chaincode install. loadFromConfig(config) Load a network configuration object or load a JSON file and update this client with any values in the config. Parameters: Name Type Description config object | string This may be the config object or a path to the configuration file &lt;async&gt; loadUserFromStateStore(name) Restore the state of the User by the given name from the key value store (if found). If not found, return null. Parameters: Name Type Description name string Name of the user Returns: A Promise for a {User} object upon successful restore, or if the user by the name does not exist in the state store, returns null without rejecting the promise Type Promise newChannel(name) Returns a Channel instance with the given name. This represents a channel and its associated ledger. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the channel. Recommend using namespaces to avoid collision. Returns: The uninitialized channel instance. Type Channel newOrderer(url, opts) Returns an Orderer object with the given url and opts. An orderer object encapsulates the properties of an orderer node and the interactions with it via the grpc stream API. Orderer objects are used by the Client objects to broadcast requests for creating and updating channels. They are used by the Channel objects to broadcast requests for ordering transactions. This method will create the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpc(s)://host:port&quot;. opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the orderer. Returns: The Orderer instance. Type Orderer newPeer(url, opts) Returns a Peer object with the given url and opts. A peer object encapsulates the properties of an endorsing peer and the interactions with it via the grpc service API. Peer objects are used by the Client objects to send channel-agnostic requests such as installing chaincode, querying peers for installed chaincodes, etc. They are also used by the Channel objects to send channel-aware requests such as instantiating chaincodes, and invoking transactions. This method will return a new Peer object. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpc(s)://host:port&quot;. opts ConnectionOpts The options for the connection to the peer. Returns: The Peer instance. Type Peer newTransactionID(admin) Returns a new TransactionID object. Fabric transaction ids are constructed as a hash of a nonce concatenated with the signing identity's serialized bytes. The TransactionID object keeps the nonce and the resulting id string bundled together as a coherent pair. This method requires the client instance to have been assigned a userContext. Parameters: Name Type Description admin boolean If true, this transactionID should be built based on the admin credentials Default is a non admin TransactionID based on the userContext. Returns: An object that contains a transaction id based on the client's userContext and a randomly generated nonce value. Type TransactionID &lt;async&gt; queryChannels(peer, useAdmin) Queries the target peer for the names of all the channels that a peer has joined. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer to send the query useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. An administrative identity must have been loaded by network configuration or by using the 'setAdminSigningIdentity' method. Returns: A promise to return a ChannelQueryResponse Type Promise &lt;async&gt; queryInstalledChaincodes(peer, useAdmin) Queries the installed chaincodes on a peer. Parameters: Name Type Description peer Peer The target peer useAdmin boolean Optional. Indicates that the admin credentials should be used in making this call to the peer. An administrative identity must have been loaded by network configuration or by using the 'setAdminSigningIdentity' method. Returns: Promise for a ChaincodeQueryResponse object Type Promise &lt;async&gt; saveUserToStateStore() Persist the current userContext to the key value store. Returns: A Promise for the userContext object upon successful persistence Type Promise setAdminSigningIdentity(private_key, certificate, mspid) Set the admin signing identity object. This method will only assign a signing identity for use by this client instance and will not persist the identity. Parameters: Name Type Description private_key string the private key PEM string certificate string the PEM-encoded string of certificate mspid string The Member Service Provider id for the local signing identity setCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) Sets the client instance to use the CryptoSuite object for signing and hashing Creating and setting a CryptoSuite is optional because the client will construct an instance based on default configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one. The specific implementation is determined by the value of this configuration setting. Parameters: Name Type Description cryptoSuite module:api.CryptoSuite the CryptoSuite object Inherited From: BaseClient#setCryptoSuite setDevMode(devMode) Set dev mode to true or false to reflect the mode of the fabric backend. See Client#isDevMode for details. Parameters: Name Type Description devMode boolean setStateStore(keyValueStore) Set an optional state store to persist application states. The state store must implement the module:api.KeyValueStore interface. The SDK supports persisting the User objects so that the heavy-weight objects such as the certificate and private keys do not have to be passed in repeatedly. Out of the box the SDK provides a file-based implementation, and a CouchDB-based implementation, which also supports Cloudant. Applications can provide alternative implementations. Parameters: Name Type Description keyValueStore module:api.KeyValueStore Instance of a KeyValueStore implementation setTlsClientCertAndKey(clientCert, clientKey) Sets the mutual TLS client side certificate and key necessary to build network endpoints when working with a network configuration (connection profile). This must be called before a peer, orderer, or channel eventhub is needed. Parameters: Name Type Description clientCert string The pem encoded client certificate. clientKey Array.&lt;byte&gt; The client key. &lt;async&gt; setUserContext(user, skipPersistence) Sets an instance of the User class as the security context of this client instance. This user’s signing identity (the private key and its corresponding certificate), will be used to sign all requests with the fabric backend. Upon setting the user context, the SDK saves the object in a persistence cache if the “state store” has been set on the Client instance. If no state store has been set, this cache will not be established and the application is responsible for setting the user context again if the application crashes and is recovered. Parameters: Name Type Description user User | UserNamePasswordObject An instance of the User class encapsulating the authenticated user’s signing materials (private key and enrollment certificate). The parameter may also be a UserNamePasswordObject that contains the username and optionally the password and caName. A network configuration must has been loaded to use the UserNamePasswordObject which will also create the user context and set it on this client instance. The created user context will be based on the current network configuration( i.e. the current organization's CA, current persistence stores). skipPersistence boolean Whether to skip saving the user object into persistence. Default is false and the method will attempt to save the user object to the state store. When using a network configuration and UserNamePasswordObject, the user object will always be stored to the persistence store. Returns: Promise of the 'user' object upon successful persistence of the user to the state store Type Promise signChannelConfig(config) Channel configuration updates can be sent to the orderers to be processed. The orderer enforces the Channel creation or update policies such that the updates will be made only when enough signatures from participating organizations are discovered in the request. Typically channel creation or update requests must be signed by participating organizations' ADMIN principals, although this policy can be customized when the consortium is defined. This method uses the client instance's current signing identity to sign over the configuration bytes passed in, and returns the signature that is ready to be included in the configuration update protobuf message to send to the orderer. Parameters: Name Type Description config Array.&lt;byte&gt; The Configuration Update in byte form Returns: - The signature of the current user on the config bytes Type ConfigSignature updateChannel(request) Calls the orderer to update an existing channel. After the channel updates are successfully processed by the orderer, the orderer cuts a new block containing the new channel configuration and delivers it to all the participating peers in the channel. Parameters: Name Type Description request ChannelRequest The request object. Returns: Promise for a result object with status on the acceptance of the update request by the orderer. A channel update is finally completed when the new channel configuration block created by the orderer has been committed to the channel's peers. To be notified of the successful update of the channel, an application should use the ChannelEventHub to connect to the peers and register a block listener.

The ECert must have been signed by one of the CAs the blockchain network has been configured to trust. An enrolled user (having a signing key and ECert) can conduct chaincode instantiate, transactions and queries with the Channel. User ECerts can be obtained from a CA beforehand as part of installing and instantiating the application, or it can be obtained from the optional Fabric CA service via its enrollment process. Sometimes User identities are confused with Peer identities. User identities represent signing capability because it has access to the private key, while Peer identities in the context of the application/SDK only has the certificate for verifying signatures. An application cannot use the Peer identity to sign things because the application doesn’t have access to the Peer identity’s private key. new User(cfg) Constructor for a member.

At a high level, a business application running on a Hyperledger Fabric network is made up of two parts: chaincode that runs in the servers (endorser nodes), and client code that runs in the Node.js application. For chaincode development, please visit the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode tutorials. For complete information on starting a Hyperledger Fabric network, please see the Build your first network tutorial. The following tutorial assumes a chaincode has been developed and the focus is developing the client application. What makes up a Hyperledger Fabric application development environment?Below you'll find a high level summary of the Hyperledger Fabric design aimed at an introductory level of understanding, so that you can be on your way to setting up the development environment. For a comprehensive description of the concepts, the architecture, please visit the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation. First of all, you will need an orderer. But isn't an orderer responsible for the consensus? Why start here? It's true that the main responsibility of the ordering service of a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is to provide consensus on a transaction among the maintainers of the ledger, a.k.a the committer nodes. However, the ordering service also maintains critical data about the overall network: what organizations are participating, what channels have been created, which organizations are part of a given channel, and last but not least what policies are in place for any kind of change to the network. In essence, the ordering service holds the network together. Ok we've got to have an orderer node so we can add participating organizations to it and get a network started. Next you would need peers for each participating organization in order to participate in transaction endorsing and maintaining the ledger. The peer nodes play two roles: endorser and committer. A peer's endorser role may be enabled or disabled based on the bootstrap configuration. Note that all peers are always committers. For high availability you would want more than one peer for each organization in a real deployment. For the development environment, one peer per organization is sufficient under most circumstances. This peer will be both an endorser and a committer. It will be sent transaction proposals to endorse and queries to discover information from the ledger. Another important role that peer nodes play is broadcasting events to interested parties. Whenever a block is added to the ledger, an event is sent by the peer through a dedicated streaming port. Any application within the organization can register themselves to listen on that port to get notified. The final piece of the puzzle is identities. Every operation in a Hyperledger Fabric network must be digitally signed for the purposes of access control, or provenance/auditing (who did what), or both. Identities are based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)) standards. Every orderer node, every peer node and every user/transactor must have a key pair with the public key wrapped in a x.509 certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). Since x.509 is an open standard, Hyperledger Fabric would work with any existing certificate authority. This is typically a painful process with lots of potential red tape to get real certificates, so for the development purposes it is a popular practice to use self-signed certificates locally generated. As you will see in the later section, the Hyperledger Fabric provides tools to make this less painful. Also related to identities, you should make a decision on whether Fabric-CA should be part of your solution. This is a server with REST APIs that supports dynamic identity management with registration, enrollment (getting certificates), revocation and re-enrollment. So it is very useful in providing user identities on the fly. Note that user identities provisioned this way are only of the MEMBER role, which means it won't be able to perform certain operations reserved for the ADMIN role: create/update channel install/instantiate chaincode query installed/instantiated chaincodes For these privileged operations, the client must use an ADMIN user to submit the request. If you choose to not use Fabric-CA, everything will still work, but the application is responsible for managing the user certificates. PrerequisitesYou will need the following software: Docker and Docker Compose - see Hyperledger Fabric for details Nodejs v8.9.0 or higher, up to 9.0 ( Node v9.0+ is not supported ) Prepare crypto materialsAs discussed above, identities are established with x.509 certificates. If you think about it, we will need a whole bunch of certificates because there are many identities involved: peers need identities to sign endorsements orderers need identities to sign proposed blocks for the committers to validate and append to the ledger applications need identities to sign transaction requests the Fabric CA themselves also need identities, so their signatures in the certificates can be validated Luckily there is a tool for that. Follow this guide to use the cryptogen tool to generate all the required keys and certificates in one swoop. Note that the cryptogen tool will automatically generate identities for the Fabric CA nodes for each orderer and peer organization, which can be used to start the Fabric-CA servers (if you choose to use it as part of the solution as discussed above). In addition, it also generates one admin user of the ADMIN role with the privileges to perform admin-level operations listed above. Finally, it also generates regular users (MEMBER role) for submitting transactions. This would get us all the crypto materials needed to start things up. Getting things rolling for real - the genesis blockAs discussed above, the orderer should be the first step to bootstrap (launch) a network. The orderer will need the initial configurations wrapped inside a genesis block. Follow the instructions here to use the congigtxgen tool to generate a genesis.block. The output, a genesis block file for the orderer, will be used in the next step to launch the orderer node. Start the networkNow we are ready to put it all together. The easiest way to launch the development environment is to use docker-compose. Follow the instructions here to start the network. To minimize the chances of a mistake, you may wish to run the network without TLS. The above steps give you a development environment.

It shows how to use an initial (default) channel definition and how to start with that definition to build a custom definition. The process to create a network and channels also involves creating and working with cryptographic material, this will not be discussed here. For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration cryptographic generation see cryptogen configuration transaction generator see configtxgen configuration translation tool see configtxlator The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), protobuf, and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. The examples shown below are based on the balance-transfer sample application. see Hyperledger Fabric Samples steps of a channel create: run the configtxgen tool to generate a genesis block run the configtxgen tool to generate an initial binary configuration definition get a sign-able channel definition in one of two ways use the initial binary channel configuration definition use the fabric-client SDK to extract the sign-able channel definition from the initial binary channel configuration definition build a custom definition use the configtxlator to convert the initial binary channel configuration definition to readable text edit the readable text more info use the configtxlator to convert the edited text to a sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to sign the sign-able channel definition use the fabric-client SDK to send the signatures and the sign-able channel definition to the orderer use the fabric-client SDK to have the peer join the channel then new channel may be used Use the initial definition to build a sign-able channel definitionThe initial binary channel configuration definition generated by the configtxgen tool is a binary file containing the Hyperledger Fabric configuration protobuf common.Envelope element. Inside this element is the common.ConfigUpdate protobuf element. This configuration element is the one that must be signed. A profile element in the configtx.yaml is the source for the initial binary channel configuration definition created by the configtxgen tool. ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannelHave the fabric-client SDK extract the config update element from the mychannel.tx file // first read in the file, this gives us a binary config envelope let envelope_bytes = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel/mychannel.tx')); // have the nodeSDK extract out the config update var config_update = client.extractChannelConfig(envelope_bytes);The binary config_update may now be used in the signing process and sent to the orderer for channel creation. You may ask why is a common.ConfigUpdate used for a create. This makes the process of create and update the same. The create of a new channel is a delta on what is defined in the system channel and an update is a delta on what is defined in the channel. The common.ConfigUpdate object submitted will only contain the changes for both a create and an update. Creating a custom sign-able channel definitionThe easiest way to get started with creating a custom channel configuration is to have the configtxlator convert an existing binary that has been or could be used to create a new channel to human readable JSON. There are many elements of the configuration and it would be very difficult to start with nothing. Using the same configtx.yaml file used to generate your Hyperledger Fabric network, use the configtxgen tool to create a initial binary configuration definition for a new channel. Then by sending that binary to the configtxlator to convert it to JSON, you will be able to see the layout and have a starting point. That JSON could also be used as a template for creating other new channels on your network. A new channel will inherit settings from the system channel for settings not defined in the new channel configuration. Organizations that will be on the new channel must be defined in a consortium on the system channel. Therefore having the readable definition of the system channel of your network would be helpful when creating a new channel. Send the genesis.block that was used to start the Hyperledger Fabric network to the configtxlator to get a JSON file to be used as a reference. Use the configtxgen tool to produce the binary config files. From the sample directory fabric-samples/balance-transfer/artifacts/channel. export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD ../../../bin/configtxgen -outputBlock genesis.block -profile TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis ../../../bin/configtxgen -channelID mychannel -outputCreateChannelTx mychannel.tx -profile TwoOrgsChannel Send the two binary files to the configtxlator service. Since this step is done only once and does not require a Node.js application, we will use cURL to simplify and speed up getting the results. Notice that configtxlator service path has decode (convert from binary to JSON). The path must also include the type of object of the binary, in the first case, it is a common.Block. The &quot;decode&quot; or &quot;encode&quot; may be done for any of the protobuf message object types found in the fabric-client\\lib\\protos directory protobuf files. First start the configtxlator service, from the fabric-samples/bin directory ./configtxlator startThen curl -X POST --data-binary @genesis.block http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Block &gt; genesis.json curl -X POST --data-binary @mychannel.tx http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/decode/common.Envelope &gt; mychannel.jsonThe results of decoding the file mychannel.tx which is a common.Envelope produced by the configtxgen tool contains a common.ConfigUpdate object. This object has the name &quot;config_update&quot; within the &quot;payload.data&quot; JSON object. This is the object that is needed as the source of the template to be used for creating new channels. The common.ConfigUpdate is the object that will be signed by all organizations and submitted to the orderer to create a new channel. The following is the extracted JSON &quot;config_update&quot; (common.ConfigUpdate) object from the decode of the &quot;TwoOrgsChannel&quot; channel create binary generated above. { &quot;channel_id&quot;: &quot;mychannel&quot;, &quot;read_set&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Application&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Org1MSP&quot;: {} } } }, &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;Consortium&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SampleConsortium&quot; } } } }, &quot;write_set&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Application&quot;: { &quot;groups&quot;: { &quot;Org1MSP&quot;: {} }, &quot;mod_policy&quot;: &quot;Admins&quot;, &quot;policies&quot;: { &quot;Admins&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;rule&quot;: &quot;MAJORITY&quot;, &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Admins&quot; } } }, &quot;Readers&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Readers&quot; } } }, &quot;Writers&quot;: { &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: 3, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;sub_policy&quot;: &quot;Writers&quot; } } } }, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1&quot; } }, &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;Consortium&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SampleConsortium&quot; } } } } }Note that the Consortium name used must exist on the system channel. All organizations that you wish to add to the new channel must be defined under in the Consortium section with that name on the system channel. Use the decoded genesis block to verify all values, for example by looking in the genesis.json file generated above. To add an organizations to the channel, they must be placed under the groups section under the Applications section as shown above. See that Org1MSP is a property of Applications.groups section. In this example all of the settings for the organization Org1MSP will be inherited from the system channel (notice the empty object &quot;{}&quot; for this organization's properties). To see the current settings for this organization look within the SampleConsortium section under the Consortium section of the system channel (the genesis block of the system channel). Once you have a JSON configuration representing your channel, send it the configtxlator to be encoded into a configuration binary. The following example of sending a REST request to the configtxlator uses the Node.js package superagent because of the ease of use for HTTP requests. var response = superagent.post('http://127.0.0.1:7059/protolator/encode/common.ConfigUpdate', config_json.toString()) .buffer() .end((err, res) =&gt; { if(err) { logger.error(err); return; } config_proto = res.body; });Signing and submitting the channel updateThe binary configuration must be signed by all organizations. The application will have to store the binary configuration and have it available to be signed along with storing all the signatures as it collects them. Then once the signing is complete, the application will send the binary configuration and all the signatures to the orderer using the fabric-client SDK API createChannel(). First the signing, assuming the client fabric-client SDK object has a valid user in a required organization var signature = client.signChannelConfig(config_proto); signatures.push(signature);Now it is time for the channel create, assuming that the signatures object is an array of common.ConfigSignature returned by the client.signChannelConfig() method. Note: The orderer must be started with the genesis.block that was generated from the same configuration file as the initial binary channel configuration definition // create an orderer object to represent the orderer of the network var orderer = client.newOrderer(url,opts); // have the SDK generate a transaction id let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); request = { config: config_proto, //the binary config signatures : signatures, // the collected signatures name : 'mychannel', // the channel name orderer : orderer, //the orderer from above txId : tx_id //the generated transaction id }; // this call will return a Promise client.createChannel(request)The createChannel API returns a Promise to return the status of the submit. The channel create will take place asynchronously by the orderer. After a small delay of a few seconds the channel will have been created by the orderer and may now be joined by the peers. Issue the following to the peers that are required on the channel. This is a two step process of first getting the genesis block of the channel and then sending it to the peer. In the following example the genesis block was retrieved from the orderer, but could have also been loaded from a file. // set the channel up with network endpoints var orderer = client.newOrderer(orderer_url,orderer_opts); channel.addOrderer(orderer); var peer = client.newPeer(peer_url,peer_opts); channel.addPeer(peer); tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let g_request = { txId : tx_id }; // get the genesis block from the orderer channel.getGenesisBlock(g_request).then((block) =&gt;{ genesis_block = block; tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); let j_request = { targets : targets, block : genesis_block, txId : tx_id }; // send genesis block to the peer return channel.joinChannel(j_request); }).then((results) =&gt;{ if(results &amp;&amp; results.response &amp;&amp; results.response.status == 200) { // join successful } else { // not good } });This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-18T08:20:03+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

These events are similar to the existing events, however are specific to a single channel. The client handling of channel-based events has a few new options when setting up a listener. Channel-based events are a new feature of the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js client as of v1.1. For more information on getting started with Fabric check out Building your first network. The following assumes an understanding of Fabric networks (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. OverviewA client application may use the Fabric Node.js client to register a &quot;listener&quot; to receive blocks as they are added to the channel ledger. We call these &quot;channel-based events&quot;, and they allow a client to start to receive blocks from a specific block number, allowing event processing to run normally on blocks that may have been missed. The Fabric Node.js client can also assist client applications by processing the incoming blocks and looking for specific transactions or chaincode events. This allows a client application to be notified of transaction completion or arbitrary chaincode events without having to perform multiple queries or search through the blocks as they are received. The service allows any user to receive &quot;filtered&quot; block events (which contain no sensitive information, in other words). Receiving &quot;unfiltered&quot; block events requires read access to the channel. The default behavior is to connect to receive filtered block events. To connect to receive unfiltered block events call connect(true) (see below). Note that if you register for a block event and then submit a transaction, you should not make any assumptions about which block contains your transaction. In particular, you should not assume that your transaction is in the block associated with the first block event received after registration to the peer's channel-based event service. Instead, you may simply register for a transaction event. APIs on the Channel newChannelEventHub(peer) -- A Channel instance method to get a new instance of a ChannelEventHub. getChannelEventHubsForOrg -- Gets a list of ChannelEventHubs based on an organization. If the organization name is omitted then the current organization of the current user is used. ChannelEventHub and APIs new in v1.1 registerBlockEvent(eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for block events. unregisterBlockEvent(reg_num) -- To remove a block registration. registerTxEvent(tx_id, eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for a specific transaction event. unregisterTxEvent(tx_id) -- To remove a specific transaction registration. registerChaincodeEvent(ccid, eventCallBack, errorCallBack, options) -- To register for chaincode events. unregisterChaincodeEvent(cc_handle) -- To remove a chaincode event registration. connect(full_block) -- To have the client channel event hub connect with the fabric channel-based event service. This call must be made before events will be received by your instance of a ChannelEventHub. When the channel-based event hub connects with the service, it will request to receive blocks or filtered blocks. If the full_block parameter is omitted, it will default to false and filtered blocks will be requested. Receiving blocks or filtered blocks can not be changed once connect() is called. When replaying blocks (by setting the startBlock and endBlock) connect() must be called after registering the listener as the connection to the peer must be setup to request existing blocks. disconnect() -- To have the client channel event hub shutdown the connection to the fabric network channel-based event service and notify all current channel event registrations of the shutdown by using the registered errorCallBacks. peer parameterThis parameter must be included when getting a new instance of the ChannelEventHub. The value may be a Peer instance or the name of a peer when using a connection profile see How to use a common network configuration file. eventCallback parameterThis parameter must be included. This is the callback function to be notified when this channel receives a new block, when listening for a specific transaction or chaincode events. errorCallback parameterThis is an optional parameter. This is the callback function to be notified when this channel event hub is shutdown. The shutdown may be caused by a fabric network error, network connection problem or by a call to the disconnect() method. This callback will also be called when the channel event hub is shutdown due to the last block being received if replaying with the endBlock set to 'newest'. options parameterThis is an optional parameter. This parameter will contain the following optional properties: {integer} startBlock -- (Optional) The starting block number for event checking. When included, the peer's channel-based event service will be asked to start sending blocks from this block number. This is also how to resume listening or replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. The default value is the number of the last block on the ledger. Replaying events may confuse other event listeners; therefore, only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when startBlock and/or endBlock are used. When this parameter is excluded (as it will be normally) the event service will be asked to start sending blocks from the last (newest) block on the ledger. {integer | 'newest'} endBlock -- (Optional) The ending block number for event checking. When included, the peer's channel-based event service will be asked to stop sending blocks once this block is delivered. This is how to replay missed blocks that were added to the ledger. When a startBlock is not included, the endBlock must be equal to or larger than the current channel block height. Replaying events may confuse other event listeners; therefore, only one listener will be allowed on a ChannelEventHub when startBlock and/or endBlock are used. The value 'newest' will indicate that 'endBlock' will be calculated by the peer as the newest block on the ledger. This allows the application to replay up to the latest block on the ledger and then the listener will stop and be notified by the 'onError' callback. {boolean} unregister -- (Optional) This setting indicates that the registration should be removed (unregister) when the event is seen. When the application is using a timeout to only wait a specified amount of time for the transaction to be seen, the timeout processing should include the manual 'unregister' of the transaction event listener to avoid the event callbacks being called unexpectedly. The default for this setting is different for the different types of event listeners. For block listeners the default is true when an end_block was set as a option. For transaction listeners the default is true. For chaincode listeners the default will be false as the match filter might be intended for many transactions. {boolean} disconnect -- (Optional) This option setting Indicates to the ChannelEventHub instance to automatically disconnect itself from the peer's channel-based event service once the event has been seen. The default is false unless the endBlock has been set, then it it will be true. Get a Channel-based Event HubNew methods have been added to the Fabric Node.js client Channel object to simplify setting up of ChannelEventHub objects. Use the following to get a ChannelEventHub instances that will be setup to work with the peer's channel-based event service. A ChannelEventHub instance will use all the same endpoint configuration settings that the peer instance is using, like the tls certs and the host and port address. When using a connection profile (see) then the peer's name may be used to get a new channel event hub. var channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub('peer0.org1.example.com');Here is an example of how to get a list of channel event hubs when using a connection profile. The following will get a list based on the current organization that is defined in the currently active client section of the connection profile. Peers defined in the organization that have the eventSource set to true will be added to the list. var channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg();When creating a peer instance, you can get a ChannelEventHub instance by using the peer instance. let data = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'somepath/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem')); let peer = client.newPeer( 'grpcs://localhost:7051', { pem: Buffer.from(data).toString(), 'ssl-target-name-override': 'peer0.org1.example.com' } ); let channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub(peer);Block ListenerWhen there is a need to monitor for new blocks being added to the ledger, use a block event listener. The Fabric client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger on the peer. The client Node.js will then call the registered callback of the application program. The callback will be passed a JSON representation of the newly added block. Note that when connect() is not called with a true value the callback will receive a filtered block. The access rights of the user registering to receive full blocks will be checked by the peer's channel-based event service. When there is a need to see previously added blocks, the registration of the callback may include a starting block number. The callback will start receiving blocks from this number and continue to receive new blocks as they are added to the ledger. This is a way for the application to resume and replay events that may have been lost if the application were to be offline. The application should remember the last block it has processed to avoid replaying the entire ledger. The following example will register a block listener to start receiving new blocks as they are added to the ledger. // keep the block_reg to unregister with later if needed block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; });The following example will register with a start block number because this application needs to resume at a specific block and replay the missed blocks. The application callback will handle the replayed blocks in the same manor like current events. The block listener will continue to receive blocks as they are committed to the ledger on the peer. // keep the block_reg to unregister with later if needed block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; }, {startBlock:23} );The following example will register with a start block number and an end block. The application needs to replay the missed blocks. The application callback will handle the replayed blocks in the same manor as current events. The block listener will be automatically unregistered and the ChannelEventHub shutdown when the end block event is seen by the listener. The application will not have to handle this housekeeping. block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((full_block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received a block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; const event_block = Long.fromValue(full_block.header.number); if(event_block.equals(current_block)) { console.log('Successfully got the last block number'); &lt;application is now up to date&gt; } }, (error)=&gt; { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; }, // for block listeners, the defaults for unregister and disconnect are true, // so they are not required to be set in the following example {startBlock:23, endBlock:30, unregister: true, disconnect: true} ); channel_event_hub.connect(true); //get full blocksThe following example will register with a start block number and an end block set to 'newest'. The error callback will be called to notify the application that the last block has been delivered and that the listener has been shutdown. block_reg = channel_event_hub.registerBlockEvent((block) =&gt; { console.log('Successfully received the block event'); &lt;do something with the block&gt; }, (error)=&gt; { if(error.toString().indexOf('Newest block received')) { console.log('Received latest block'); &lt;application is now up to date&gt; } else { console.log('Failed to receive the block event ::'+error); &lt;do something with the error&gt; } }, {startBlock:23, endBlock:'newest'} );Transaction listenerWhen there is a need to monitor for the completion of a transaction on your organization's peer, use a transaction listener. The client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger on the peer. The client will then check the block for registered transaction identifiers. If a transaction is found then the callback will be notified with the transaction ID, the transaction status, and the block number. Filtered blocks contain the transaction status, so there is no need to connect to the peer's channel-based event service to receive full blocks. Since most non-admin users will not be able to see full blocks, connecting to receive filtered blocks will avoid access issues when those users only need to listen for their transactions to be committed. The following example will show registering a transaction ID within a javascript promise and building another promise for sending the transaction to the orderer. Both promises will be executed together so that the results will be received for both actions together. The default optional setting of unregister is true with a transaction listener. Therefore in the following example the listener that is registered will be automatically unregistered after the listener sees the transaction. let tx_object = client.newTransactionID(); // get the transaction ID string for later use let tx_id = tx_object.getTransactionID(); let request = { targets : targets, chaincodeId: 'my_chaincode', fcn: 'invoke', args: ['doSomething', 'with this data'], txId: tx_object }; return channel.sendTransactionProposal(request); }).then((results) =&gt; { // a real application would check the proposal results console.log('Successfully endorsed proposal to invoke chaincode'); // start block may be null if there is no need to resume or replay let start_block = getBlockFromSomewhere(); let event_monitor = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { let handle = setTimeout(() =&gt; { // do the housekeeping when there is a problem channel_event_hub.unregisterTxEvent(tx_id); console.log('Timeout - Failed to receive the transaction event'); reject(new Error('Timed out waiting for block event')); }, 20000); channel_event_hub.registerTxEvent((event_tx_id, status, block_num) =&gt; { clearTimeout(handle); //channel_event_hub.unregisterTxEvent(event_tx_id); let the default do this console.log('Successfully received the transaction event'); storeBlockNumForLater(block_num); resolve(status); }, (error)=&gt; { clearTimeout(handle); console.log('Failed to receive the transaction event ::'+error); reject(error); }, // when this `startBlock` is null (the normal case) transaction // checking will start with the latest block {startBlock:start_block} // notice that `unregister` is not specified, so it will default to true // `disconnect` is also not specified and will default to false ); channel_event_hub.connect(); }); let send_trans = channel.sendTransaction({proposalResponses: results[0], proposal: results[1]}); return Promise.all([event_monitor, send_trans]); }).then((results) =&gt; {Chaincode event listenerWhen there is a need to monitor for events that will be posted from within your chaincode, use a chaincode event listener. The client Node.js will be notified when a new block is committed to the ledger. The client will then check for registered chaincode patterns within the chaincode event's name field. The registration of the listener includes a regular expression to be used in the check against a chaincode event name. If a chaincode event name is found to match the listener's regular expression then the listener's callback will be notified with the chaincode event, the block number, transaction id, and transaction status. Filtered blocks will not have the chaincode event payload information; it has only the chaincode event name. If the payload information is required, the user must have access to the full block and the channel event hub must be connect(true) to receive the full block events from the peer's channel-based event service. The following example demonstrates registering a chaincode event listener within a javascript promise and building another promise for sending the transaction to the orderer. Both promises will be executed together so that the results will be received for both actions together.

For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration Service Discovery The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript promise and async await. OverviewThe service discovery provided by the Hyperledger Fabric helps an application to understand the current view of the network. The service discovery also has insight into the endorsement policy of chaincodes and is able to provide various list of peers that are currently active on the network that could be used to endorse a proposal. To use the service the application will have to connect with just one peer. Modified API's that will use the service discovery channel.initialize() - This method has been enhanced by adding an option to query a peer using the new service discovery to initialize the channel object. channel.sendTransactionProposal() - This method has been enhanced to use the discovered peers to send the endorsement proposal. channel.sendTransaction() - This method has been enhanced to use the discovered orderers to send the signed endorsements. New API's that will use service discovery channel.refresh() - The channel will be refreshed with new service discovery results, add new peers, orderers, and MSPs. The call will use the service discovery settings as provided on the channel.initialize() call. getDiscoveryResults - The channel will cache the results of the last query made to the service discovery and make the results available. The call will use the discovery-cache-life setting to determine if the results should be refreshed. if the results need to be refreshed, the channel.refresh() will be called internally to fetch new service discovery results. The call is used by the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler as it starts to determine the target peers. New configuration settings initialize-with-discovery - boolean - When the applications calls for the channel to be initialized, service discovery will be used. (default false) discovery-cache-life - integer (time in milliseconds) - The amount of time the service discovery results are considered valid. (default 300000 - 5 minutes) discovery-protocol - string - The protocol to use when building URL's for the discovered endpoints. The Discover Service only provides host:port. (default 'grpcs'). endorsement-handler - string - The path to the endorsement handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransactionProposal method to determine the target peers and how to send the proposal. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/DiscoveryEndorsementHandler.js') commit-handler - string - The path to the commit handler. Allows for a custom handler to be used. This handler is used in the sendTransaction method to determine the orderers and how to send the transaction to be committed. (default 'fabric-client/lib/impl/BasicCommitHandler.js') new EndorsementHandlerThe sending of a proposal to be endorsed may be done using a custom code. The fabric-client will use by default the file called DiscoveryEndorsementHandler. The endorsement handler may be changed by changing the configuration setting &quot;endorsement-handler&quot; by doing a setConfigSetting() or placing a new line in configuration JSON file that application has applied to the fabric-client configuration. Client.setConfigSetting('endorsement-handler', '/path/to/the/handler.js'); --or-- Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line // &quot;endorsement-handler&quot;: &quot;/path/to/the/handler.js&quot;A endorsement handler must implement the api.EndorsementHandler. When the channel is instantiated, the channel will read the path setting and create an instance of the handler for use by the new channel instance. How the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler worksThe default handler that comes with the fabric-client is designed to use the results of a discover service query. The sendTransactionProposal call allows for the target peers to be specified, the handler will honor that request and send to list as indicated. The handler assumes that the query has been made and is current. If there are no service discover results, the handler will send to peers that have been assigned to the channel with the endorsingPeer role (a peer that has been assigned to the channel without defining a role will have the role by default). The handler assumes that all peers referenced in the endorsement plans have had a peer object created and assigned to the channel object. The service discover handler takes optional parameters that allow the user to specify peers to be preferred and to be ignored. The handler will determine the chaincode that will make the endorsement and finds the peer endorsement plan within the service discover results. The plan will include groups of peers and layouts that specify how many peers from each group it will take to satisfy the endorsement policy of the chaincode. The service discovery does not actually send the endorsement policy as part of the service discover results, the service sends a plan with layouts and groups that guide the fabric-client on how to send requests that will produce a set of endorsements that will be able to be successfully committed. The handler will first sort each group of peers, moving peers on the preferred list to the top, moving peers with a higher ledger block height up, and removing any peers that need to be ignored. The handler will then select the first layout and build a list of outbound requests. The handler looks at each group called out in the layout and selects, starting the top of sorted group list, the number of peers called out in the layout. The handler then sends all the request out at once. If any of the request fail the handler will select another peer from the group list. If the enough successful endorsements are returned and the layout is satisfied, the handler returns the results. If there are not enough successful endorsements the handler will select the next layout and try again or return the results of last attempt. new CommitHandlerThe sending of the endorsements to be committed may be done using custom code. The fabric-client will use by default the file called BasicCommitHandler. The commit handler may be changed by changing the configuration setting &quot;commit-handler&quot; by doing a setConfigSetting() or placing a new line in configuration JSON file that application has applied to the fabric-client configuration. Client.setConfigSetting('commit-handler', '/path/to/the/handler.js'); --or-- Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line // &quot;commit-handler&quot;: &quot;/path/to/the/handler.js&quot;A commit handler must implement the api.CommmitHandler. When the channel is instantiated, the channel will read the path setting and create an instance of the handler for use by the new channel instance. How the BasicCommitHandler worksThe default handler that comes with the fabric-client will send to one orderer at a time until it receives a successful submission of the transaction. Sending a transaction (a set of endorsements) to an orderer does not mean that the transaction will be committed, it means that the request was built properly and that the sender has the authority to send the request. The response from the orderer will indicate that the orderer has accepted the request. The sendTransaction has an optional parameter orderer that indicates the orderer to send the transaction. The handler will use the orderer as specified with the orderer parameter and send to any other orderers. If no orderer is specified the handler will get the list of orderers assigned to the channel. These orderers may have been assigned manually to the channel with a channel.addOrderer() call or automatically when using the service discovery. To InitializeBy default the fabric-client will not use the service discovery. To enable the use of the service, set the config setting to true or use the discover parameter on the initialize() call. Client.setConfigSetting('initialize-with-discovery', true); --or-- Client.addConfigFile('/path/to/config.json'); // the json file contains the following line //&quot;initialize-with-discovery&quot;: true //--or-- await channel.initialize({discover:true});To use the service discovery on the initialize(), a channel must have at least one peer assigned with the discovery role or a target must be provided on the call. Peers may be assigned automatically by loading a connection profile or they may have been added manually with the channel.addPeer(). await channel.initialize({ discover: true, target: peer }); //--or-- await channel.initialize({ discover: true, target: 'peer2.org2.example.com' //peer defined in the connection profile }); //--or-- // no target specified, using the first peer with the discover role // peer was added to the channel either by the 'addPeer' or when using // a connection profile await channel.initialize({ discover: true });The return results of initialization with service discover will be the MSP configurations, the peers, the orderers, and the endorsing plans for all chaincodes on the channel in JSON format. The results are stored and cached internally and the caller does not have to do anything with the results, they are provided only for reference. The initialize call also allows for changing the endorsement handler by specifying a path to a custom endorsement handler. The handler may be changed independently of using the service discovery. The default endorsement handler however does use discover service results to determine the endorsing peers. await channel.initialize({ endorsementHandler: '/path/to/my/handler.js' });When the fabric network is running in a docker-compose and the node.js application is running outside of the docker containers, it will be necessary to modify the addresses returned from the service discovery. The service discovery sees the addresses of the peers and orderers as host names and ports, however the node.js application running outside of docker will only know the endpoints as localhost and port. In the docker-compose file, notice how Docker is mapping the port addresses, these must be same when using service discovery. Using - 7061:7051 will not work as the fabric-client does not have visibility into the docker-compose file. Notice in the following definition of a peer from a docker-compose file. The port number is the same and has been defined along with the host name peer0.org1.example.com:7051 for the peer and gossip settings. The node.js fabric-client application running outside of of the docker containers will use localhost:7051. peer0.org1.example.com: container_name: peer0.org1.example.com image: hyperledger/fabric-peer environment: - CORE_VM_ENDPOINT=unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock - CORE_PEER_ID=peer0.org1.example.com - CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_LISTENADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_ENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 - CORE_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug ## the following setting redirects chaincode container logs to the peer container logs - CORE_VM_DOCKER_ATTACHSTDOUT=true - CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP - CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer ## - CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=true - CORE_PEER_TLS_KEY_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/key.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/tls/cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem - CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTROOTCAS_FILES=/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer/cacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem # # the following setting starts chaincode containers on the same # # bridge network as the peers # # https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/ - CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=fixtures_default working_dir: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric command: peer node start ports: - 7051:7051 volumes: - /var/run/:/host/var/run/ - ./channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/:/etc/hyperledger/msp/peer depends_on: - orderer.example.comThe channel.initialize() call as new parameter to indicate that the hostname mapping to localhost should be done. Use the asLocalhost with true or false, the default is false. await channel.initialize({discover:true, asLocalhost:true})Using peers added manually to the channel:Only one peer will now be required to be added to the channel when the applications programmatically adds the peers and orderers to build a channel instance. The peer must have the role discover. As with all roles, if the role is not defined and set to false, the peer will have that role on the channel by default. const channel = client.newChannel('mychannel'); const peer = client.newPeer(....); channel.addPeer(peer); await channel.initialize({discover:true});When the channel is initialized using service discover and peers and orderers are added to the channel, a peer with the address that was used for service discover will likely be on the list of discovered peers. A peer with the address used for service discover will not be added again to the channel as a peer with that address has already been assigned to the channel. The name a peer will be known by may be set by using the name setting when creating the peer. const peer = client.newPeer(url, {name: 'peer0', ...});The default name of a peer will be the host name and port if the name parameter is not provided or for peers added by service discovery. peer0.org1.example.com:7051Using peers not added to the channel:To use the service discovery a starting point is required. The application may define a peer and pass it on the initialize call. The peer does not have to be added to the channel instance. const channel = client.newChannel('mychannel'); const peer = client.newPeer(....); await channel.initialize({discover:true, target:peer});When the channel is initialized using service discover and peers and orderers are added to the channel, a peer with the address that was used for service discover will likely be on the list of discovered peers. A peer instance with the address used for service discover will be added to the channel with the same address that the peer instance used for service discover. Using connection profile:When using a connection profile, all the peers and orderers on the network will no longer need to be provided. Just one peer will be required and assigned to the channel. The peer must have the role discover. As with all roles, if the role is not defined and set to false, the peer will have that role on the channel by default. The following example shows a peer that is going to be used primarily for service discover. channels: mychannel: peers: peer1.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: false chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false discover: true peer2.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: true ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false discover: false peers: peer1.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer1.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c... peer2.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8052 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer2.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/c...When a channel is created using the client.getChannel() after the client instance has loaded a connection profile, the fabric-client will create peers and assign them to the channel. Peers with the the discover role will be used when the channel.initialize() is called and no peer is passed as a target. const client = Client.loadFromConfig(...); const channel = client.getChannel('mychannel'); await channel.initialize({discover:true, asLocalhost:true};If the initialize fails because the peer with the discover role is not online, the application may select another peer. await channel.initialize({discover:true, target:'peer2.org2.example.com'});When the application passes a peer name or a peer instance to the initialize call, that peer will be used and the discover role will not be checked. The name a peer will be known by is the name used in the yaml file. peer1.org2.example.com:portThe name of a peer will be the host name and port for peers added by the service discovery. peer0.org1.example.com:7051To EndorseAs discussed above, the channel.sendTransactionProposal() will now use a pluggable handler. The fabric-client will come with a handler that will use service discover. By default the endorsement-handler configuration setting will point to the DiscoveryEndorsementHandler. If the channel has been initialized using the service discovery and there are no targets define on the sendTransactionProposal call, the handler will use the service discover results to determine the target peers to perform the endorsements. const tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id }; await channel.sendTransactionProposal(request);The application is able to have specific peers chosen before other peers or to be not chosen at all for endorsements. The application may add the following optional settings to the request object. preferred: An array of strings that represent the names of peers that should be given priority by the endorsement. This list only applies to endorsements using the service discovery. ignored: An array of strings that represent the names of peers that should be ignored by the endorsement. This list only applies to endorsements using the service discovery. Notice in the following example the names would indicate that some peers were manually added to the channel and some where added by service discover. const request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id, preferred: ['peer0', 'peer1.org1.exmaple.com:8051'], ignored: ['peer1', 'peer2.org2.example.com:8054'] }To CommitAs discussed above, the channel.sendTransaction() will now use a pluggable handler. The fabric-client will come with a handler that will use all orderers added to the channel. By default the commit-handler configuration setting will point to the BasicCommitHandler. This handler will send the transaction to each orderer, one at a time, that has been assigned to the channel until it gets a SUCCESS response or until the list is exhausted. The orderers may been added manually, due to a service discover initialization or combination of the two. If an orderer is specified on the call, only that orderer will be used.

As of v1.1 the only metadata are the indexes that may be added to a CouchDB state database of your channel ledger. For more information: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric setting up a CouchDB as the state database The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. OverviewFabric 1.1 has introduced the capability of defining indexes in a CouchDB state database to help improve performance of your queries made in your chaincode. The index definitions need to be in JSON format and in files with a .json extension. These definitions will be included in the chaincode installation package that is sent to the Fabric peer. Modified API's that allow for metadata client.installChaincode() - There is a new attribute ('metadataPath') that may be included in the installation request. The value of the metadataPath is a string representing the absolute path to the directory structure containing the JSON index files. Installing chaincodeThe following example will install the chaincode 'my_chaincode' and include index files. let targets = buildTargets(); //build the list of peers that will require this chaincode let chaincode_path = path.resolve(__dirname, '../chaincode/src/node_cc/my_chaincode'); let metadata_path = path.resolve(__dirname, '../chaincode/my_indexes'); // send proposal to install var request = { targets: targets, chaincodePath: chaincode_path, metadataPath: metadata_path, // notice this is the new attribute of the request chaincodeId: 'my_chaincode', chaincodeType: 'node', chaincodeVersion: 'v1' }; client.installChaincode(request).then((results) =&gt; { var proposalResponses = results[0]; // check the results }, (err) =&gt; { console.log('Failed to send install proposal due to error: ' + err.stack ? err.stack : err); throw new Error('Failed to send install proposal due to error: ' + err.stack ? err.stack : err); });The following shows the path used as the metadataPath above. This is the required directory structure required under the path. The indexes directory will hold the files with the index definitions. The required directory structure and files with a 'json' extension will be included in the chaincode installation package under the 'META_INF' package directory. 'META-INF' should not be included in your local directory structure. .. &lt;&gt; chaincode │ └─── &lt;&gt; my_indexes // here is where the 'metadataPath' will point to │ └─── &lt;&gt; statedb //starting here are the required directories │ └─── &lt;&gt; couchdb │ └─── &lt;&gt; indexes // this directory will contain the index files index-owner.json // these will be the index files and must index-address.json // have the file extension of 'json'Each index must be defined in its own text file with an extension of *.json and contain the index definition formatted in JSON following the CouchDB index JSON syntax. {&quot;index&quot;:{&quot;fields&quot;:[&quot;docType&quot;,&quot;owner&quot;]},&quot;ddoc&quot;:&quot;indexOwnerDoc&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;indexOwner&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;json&quot;}This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-18T08:20:03+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Connection profiles are a new feature of the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Client as of 1.1. A connection profile will describe the Hyperledger Fabric network to the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Client (fabric client). For more information on: getting started with Hyperledger Fabric see Building your first network. the configuration of a channel in Hyperledger Fabric and the internal process of creating and updating see Hyperledger Fabric channel configuration cryptographic generation see cryptogen configuration transaction generator see configtxgen configuration translation tool see configtxlator The following assumes an understanding of the Hyperledger Fabric network (orderers and peers), and of Node application development, including the use of the Javascript Promise. OverviewA connection profile contain entries that describe the Hyperledger Fabric network including entries that describe the fabric client that will access the the network. The application will load a configuration file and then it will be used by fabric client to simplify the steps needed to setup and use the network. The connection profile has specific addresses and settings of network items. Resources like javascript classes to instantiate are stored in the fabric client's configuration system. It will be easier to work with a fabric client loaded with a connection profile configuration because it reduces the setup before calling an action. Parameters for items like targets may be specified by name and object will not have to be created and maintained before the action is called. On many calls if no target peer is specified, the fabric client will look to see if there is a Peer in the role needed for the action. API's to load a connection profile Client.loadFromConfig() - A static utility method to get a fabric client instance loaded with the connection profile configuration. client.loadFromConfig() - A fabric client instance method to load a connection profile configuration, overriding any existing connection profile configuration settings that may have been set when this client object was created by the call above. new API's that use a loaded connection profile client.initCredentialStores() - A fabric client instance method to create a state store and assign it to the fabric client instance based on the current settings in the loaded connection profile configuration. It will also create the crypto suite and assign it to the fabric client instance. A crypto store will be created and assigned to crypto suite if needed. (HSM based crypto suites do not require a crypto store). client.setTlsClientCertAndKey(clientCert, clientKey) -A fabric client instance method that will set a certificate and the corresponding private key on the client instance. Mutual TLS client settings are not stored within the connection profile. When a peer or orderer instance is created for the user from the endpoints defined in the connection profile, these settings will be used as the client mutual TLS settings. When using mutual TLS and a connection profile, this method must be called before endpoints are required. Calling this method is only required when using mutual TLS and a connection profile. channel.newChannelEventHub() - A fabric channel instance method to create an channel-based event hub based on the current settings in the loaded connection profile configuration of the named peer. channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg() - A fabric channel instance method to return a list of channel-based event hubs that are associated with an organizations. Peers in an organizations that have the eventSource set to true will be returned. client.getPeersForOrg() - A fabric client instance method to return a list of peer objects that are associated with an organizations. Modified API's that will use the connection profile configuration if one has been loaded client.getChannel() - A fabric client instance method that will create a channel instance object based on the settings for a channel defined in the currently loaded connection profile configuration. client.newTransactionID(&lt;boolean&gt;) - This method was modified to allow for a boolean to indicate that the transaction id generated should be based on the administrative identity if one has been assigned rather than the user context assigned to the fabric client. client.setUserContext() - Now allows username and password as a parameter or a User object. When username and password are used the fabric client will perform an enroll with the certificate authority using the username and password. client.installChaincode() - If the targets parameter is excluded from the request parameter list then the peers defined in the current organization of the client will be used. client.queryXXXX() - The query API's will now take a peer name (as defined in the connection profile config) or peer object instance as the target. channel.instantiateChaincode() - If the targets parameter is excluded from the request parameter list then the peers defined in the current organization of the client that are also on this channel will be used. channel.sendTransactionProposal() The request object parameter may use names for targets or let the fabric client find peers to use for targets as defined in the connection profile configuration. channel.sendTransaction() The request object parameter may use orderer name or let the fabric client find an orderer to use as defined in the connection profile configuration. channel.queryXXXX() - All the query API's will now take a peer name as the target rather than an peer instance object. Loading connection profile configurationsThe application code can either point to a yaml or json file that contains the configuration information or it may pass a Javascript object directory to the API's to load a configuration. For convenience there is a static utility method on the fabric-client to create a new fabric client object and load a connection profile configuration at the same time. There is also a method on the fabric client instance that may be used to load a connection profile configuration on top of an existing connection profile configuration. The following example will create a new instance of the fabric-client and load a connection profile configuration. However in this case the connection profile configuration does not contain any information about the client side of the fabric network, just the fabric network elements. var client = Client.loadFromConfig('test/fixtures/network.yaml');Here is the connection profile definition loaded name: &quot;Network&quot; version: &quot;1.0&quot; channels: mychannel: orderers: - orderer.example.com peers: peer0.org1.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: true ledgerQuery: true eventSource: true peer0.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false organizations: Org1: mspid: Org1MSP peers: - peer0.org1.example.com certificateAuthorities: - ca-org1 adminPrivateKey: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/keystore/9022d671ceedbb24af3ea69b5a8136cc64203df6b9920e26f48123fcfcb1d2e9_sk signedCert: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/signcerts/Admin@org1.example.com-cert.pem Org2: mspid: Org2MSP peers: - peer0.org2.example.com certificateAuthorities: - ca-org2 adminPrivateKey: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/keystore/5a983ddcbefe52a7f9b8ee5b85a590c3e3a43c4ccd70c7795bec504e7f74848d_sk signedCert: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/signcerts/Admin@org2.example.com-cert.pem orderers: orderer.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7050 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: orderer.example.com grpc-max-send-message-length: 15 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/tlscacerts/example.com-cert.pem peers: peer0.org1.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com grpc.keepalive_time_ms: 600000 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pem peer0.org2.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:8051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org2.example.com tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tlscacerts/org2.example.com-cert.pem certificateAuthorities: ca-org1: url: https://localhost:7054 httpOptions: verify: false tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/ca/org1.example.com-cert.pem registrar: - enrollId: admin enrollSecret: adminpw caName: caorg1 ca-org2: url: https://localhost:8054 httpOptions: verify: false tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/ca/org2.example.com-cert.pem registrar: - enrollId: admin enrollSecret: adminpw caName: caorg2The following example will have an existing fabric client load a connection profile configuration. The definition will only contain client side definitions and no fabric network definitions. Calling for a load on an existing fabric client does an overlay of the top level sections in the file being loaded replacing the sections on those previously loaded. In this case the file being loaded only has a client section, therefore the loaded definition will now have the previously loaded channels, organizations, peers, orderers, and certificateAuthorities section definitions and the newly loaded client section definition. This allows for an existing fabric client to be able to work within different organization. client.loadFromConfig('test/fixtures/org1.yaml');Here is the client definition loaded above name: &quot;Org1 Client&quot; version: &quot;1.0&quot; client: organization: Org1 credentialStore: path: &quot;/tmp/hfc-kvs/org1&quot; cryptoStore: path: &quot;/tmp/hfc-cvs/org1&quot;Setup the storesThe next step is to set up the client object with the state and crypto stores. If the client section of the connection profile configuration has these defined then it is a simple matter of running the following. This API is promise based, notice that we will need a .then on the returned promise to have it actually execute. This API does not return anything, however it has created a state store and assigned it to the client, it has created a CryptoSuite and also assigned it to the client, and created a crypto store and assigned that to the crypto suite. Notice the credentialStore and cryptoStore definitions above in the client section of the connection profile configuration. In this case we are using two different locations, it may be easier to have these in the same locations when first starting out. The following will create two stores and a CryptoSuite and assign them to the fabric client all based on the loaded configurations. client.initCredentialStores() .then((nothing) =&gt; {Work with user contextWhen there is certificate Authority information on the organization, the fabric client may be used to simplify the enrollment and user context creation. The application will still have to register new users with the certificate authority, however when a connection profile configuration has been loaded there a simpler way to get a certificate authority client. So first let's enroll an admin user so that we have the credentials (crypto material) needed to interact with the certificate authority and the fabric network. The following convenience method will first look in the state store (as defined above) to see if the user exist. If the user is not found and there is a connection profile configuration loaded, the fabric client will build a certificate authority client object as defined in the fabric client configuration with the address as defined in the currently loaded connection profile configuration. The fabric client uses the certificate authority client to enroll the admin user with the certificate authority, this requires that a new set of keys be generated on the client side. The fabric client will then use the signed certificate returned by the certificate authority from the enroll to create a user context. The context will then be assign it to fabric client and stored in the state store along with storing the keys in the crypto store. At this point the fabric client is ready to interact with the fabric network and the application may use the returned user object to interact with the certificate authority. In the following example we are able to enroll the user because it known by the certificate authority. New users will have to be registered first. client.setUserContext({username:'admin', password:'adminpw'}) .then((admin) =&gt; {The following example will have the fabric client build a certificate authority client based on the currently loaded connection profile configuration by first finding which organization defined in the client section and then finding the certificate authority associated with that organization. var fabric_ca_client = client.getCertificateAuthority();Then once we have a fabric-ca-client, we will be able to register new users. We could also use the fabric-ca-client to enroll users and make a few calls to the fabric client to create a user object and then assign that user object to the fabric client, but it will be much easier to just use the convenience method of the fabric client instance. Notice how we have to use the 'admin' user object returned from the client.setUserContext() to do the register. The admin user object has the credentials needed to the register. Then notice we called the same setUserContext method as we did with the admin above, this will have the fabric client object assigned with the 'user1' user context thus providing the credentials to interact with the fabric network. Note that the setUserContext also stores the user context which contains the signed certificate from the certificate authority and newly created public and private keys of the now enrolled user. fabric_ca_client.register({enrollmentID: 'user1', affiliation: 'org1'}, admin) .then((secret) =&gt; { return client.setUserContext({username:'user1', password:secret}); }).then((user)=&gt; {Work with mutual TLSWhen your network configuration includes mutual TLS, the client certificate and private key must be available to the client instance before the endpoints are automatically built. The client instance will be able to pass the required material to the endpoint instance that is needed to establish the connection. The example shown will also retrieve the material. These steps must be performed before any actions on the fabric network. // get the CA associated with this client's organization let fabric_ca_client = client.getCertificateAuthority(); let request = { enrollmentID: 'user1', enrollmentSecret: secret, profile: 'tls' }; // make the request to build the keys and get the certificate fabric_ca_client.enroll(request) .then((enrollment) =&gt; { // Successfully called the Certificate Authority to get the TLS material let key = enrollment.key.toBytes(); let cert = enrollment.certificate; // set the material on the client to be used when building endpoints for the user client.setTlsClientCertAndKey(cert, key); ...When an admin is neededNotice in the organizations section of the connection profile configuration that an organization may have a signed cert setting and admin private key setting that are associated with the organization. This is a convenience for your organization such that operations that require a fabric network administrator will be able to get one easily. These credentials will be assigned to the fabric client when the configuration is loaded. If one has not been assigned than the current user context assigned to the fabric client is assumed to be an administrator. There is also a convenience method on the client object that will assign credentials to the client to be used for operations that require an admin. client.setAdminSigningIdentity('admin privateKey','admin cert');Assume that connection profile configurations have been loaded, setting up both an organization with an admin and indicating that the client is in that organization. Then when the call is made to get a transaction id object, the fabric client will check to see if an admin has been assigned to the fabric client and use that to generate the transaction id. The transaction id returned will be tagged that it was generated with the assigned administrative identity. Notice how the request object being built is using just a name for the orderer rather than a Orderer object. The fabric client will look up this name in the loaded connection profile configuration. When the createChannel call is made, the fabric client will know that this action should be signed by the administrative identity because the transaction id was marked as an admin based transaction. Note that the administrative signing identity is not required if the logged in user is an administrative user and has been assigned to the fabric client. let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(true); let request = { config: config, signatures : signatures, name : channel_name, orderer : 'orderer.example.com', txId : tx_id }; return client.createChannel(request); }).then((result) =&gt; {When a peer is neededNotice how a peer is added to an organization, it is more than just a reference to the actual peer definition, the peer is also defined to have roles within that organization. peer0.org2.example.com: endorsingPeer: true chaincodeQuery: false ledgerQuery: true eventSource: false This peer may be used to endorse transaction, but not used to run chaincode queries. This peer may be used to audit the channel by making ledger based queries (like queryBlock), but may not be used to be an event source. Of course this combination of roles does not make much sense in real life. So let's have a look at a chaincode invoke endorsement let tx_id = client.newTransactionID(); var request = { chaincodeId : 'example', fcn: 'move', args: ['a', 'b','100'], txId: tx_id }; channel.sendTransactionProposal(request) .then((results) =&gt; {Notice that we have left off the targets parameter of the request object. This will have the fabric client do a lookup of peers on this channel in the connection profile configuration. The fabric client will be looking for peers defined in the role of endorsingPeer. The fabric client will then send the proposal to the located peers and return all the endorsements in the results object. There may be a need to have only the peers in a specific organization. Use the mspid of the organization. var peers = getPeersForOrg('Org1MSP');Or maybe for the organization that is defined in the client section of the connection profile. var peers = getPeersForOrg();When an orderer is neededAfter receiving endorsements from the peers for a transaction proposal, they will need to be sent to an orderer along with the proposal for a transaction to be committed to the ledger. var request = { proposalResponses: proposalResponses, proposal: proposal }; channel.sendTransaction(request) .then((results) =&gt; {Notice that an orderer to send this transaction to is not included in the request object. The orderer defined in the connection profile configuration will be used. When doing queriesWhen there is a connection profile configuration loaded and the query call is not passed a target peer to use, the fabric client will look in the connection profile configuration for a peer to use. These are fabric client based queries and require the user have an admin role or indicate that the admin identity should be used. These queries do not use the connection profile config lookup to find a peer to use and must be passed the target peer. queryChannels queryInstalledChaincodes These queries are channel based queries that require a peer with the ledgerQuery role. queryInstantiatedChaincodes (user must be an admin or indicate that the assigned admin identity should be used) queryInfo queryBlockByHash queryBlock queryTransaction this is a channel based query and requires a peer with the chaincodeQuery role. queryByChaincode When monitoring for eventsWorking with an channel-based event hub will not changed when a connection profile configuration has been loaded. A new method has been added to the fabric client to simplify setting up of an ChannelEventHub object. Use the following to get an ChannelEventHub object that will be setup to work with the named peer's channel-based event hub. var channel_event_hub = channel.newChannelEventHub('peer0.org1.example.com');Notice how the parameter to the call is the name of the peer. All settings to create an channel-based event hub are defined by the connection profile configuration under the peer by that name. peer0.org1.example.com: url: grpcs://localhost:7051 grpcOptions: ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com grpc.keepalive_time_ms: 600000 tlsCACerts: path: test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tlscacerts/org1.example.com-cert.pemThe following will be a list of event hubs that are within the 'Org1' organization. All peers referenced by an organization that the 'eventSource' set to true. Use the mspid of the organization. var channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg('Org1MSP');The following will be a list of channel-based event hubs that are within the organization defined in the client section of the connection profile. var channel_event_hubs = channel.getChannelEventHubsForOrg();This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-18T08:20:03+00:00 using the DocStrap template.

Starting in v1.2, Fabric offers the ability to create private data collections, which allows a subset of organizations on a channel to endorse, commit, or query private data without having to create a separate channel.For more information, refer to Private Data Concept, Private Data Architecture, and Using Private Data in Fabric. OverviewThe following are the steps to use private data with the Node.js SDK. Check out below sections for the details of these steps. Create a collection definition json file Implement chaincode to store and query private data Install and instantiate chaincode with a collection definition Invoke chaincode to store and query private data Purge private data Create a collection definition json fileA collection definition describes who can persist data, how many peers the data is distributed to, how many peers are required to disseminate the private data, and how long the private data is persisted in the private database. Chaincode APIs will map the collection to the private data by the collection name. A collection definition is composed of the following five properties. name: Name of the collection. policy: Defines the organization peers allowed to persist the collection data. requiredPeerCount: Number of peers required to disseminate the private data as a condition of the endorsement of the chaincode maxPeerCount: For data redundancy purposes, the number of other peers that the current endorsing peer will attempt to distribute the data to. If an endorsing peer goes down, these other peers are available at commit time if there are requests to pull the private data. blockToLive: For very sensitive information such as pricing or personal information, this value represents how long the data should live on the private database in terms of blocks. The data will be purged after this specified number of blocks on the private database. To keep private data indefinitely, that is, to never purge private data, set the blockToLive property to 0. Here is a sample collection definition JSON file, containing an array of two collection definitions: [{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;collectionMarbles&quot;, &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;identities&quot;: [{ &quot;role&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;member&quot;, &quot;mspId&quot;: &quot;Org1MSP&quot; } }, { &quot;role&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;member&quot;, &quot;mspId&quot;: &quot;Org2MSP&quot; } } ], &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;1-of&quot;: [ { &quot;signed-by&quot;: 0 }, { &quot;signed-by&quot;: 1 } ] } }, &quot;requiredPeerCount&quot;: 1, &quot;maxPeerCount&quot;: 2, &quot;blockToLive&quot;: 100 }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;collectionMarblePrivateDetails&quot;, &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;identities&quot;: [{ &quot;role&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;member&quot;, &quot;mspId&quot;: &quot;Org1MSP&quot; } }], &quot;policy&quot;: { &quot;1-of&quot;: [{ &quot;signed-by&quot;: 0 }] } }, &quot;requiredPeerCount&quot;: 1, &quot;maxPeerCount&quot;: 1, &quot;blockToLive&quot;: 100 } ]This example contains two private data collections: collectionMarbles and collectionMarblePrivateDetails. The policy property in the collectionMarbles definition allows all members of the channel (Org1 and Org2) to have the private data in a private database. The collectionMarblesPrivateDetails collection allows only members of Org1 to have the private data in their private database. For Node.js SDK, you must define policies in the same format as shown in the above. Implement chaincode to store and query private dataFabric provides chaincode APIs to store and query private data. As an example, check out marbles private data example to understand how to use the chaincode APIs to read and write private data. This example implements the following functions to manage private data. readMarble: query the values of the name, color, size and owner attributes using collection collectionMarbles. readMarblePrivateDetails: query the values of the price attribute using collection collectionMarblePrivateDetails. initMarble: store private data for the collections. delete: delete a marble from private database. Install and instantiate chaincode with a collection definitionClient applications interact with the blockchain ledger through chaincode. As such we need to install and instantiate the chaincode on every peer that will execute and endorse transactions. Install chaincode. No specific parameter needed to support private data. Instantiate chaincode. To support private data, the request must include the collections-config attribute. const collectionsConfigPath = path.resolve(__dirname, collection_definition_json_filepath); var request = { targets: peers, chaincodeId: chaincodeId, chaincodeType: chaincodeType, chaincodeVersion: chaincodeVersion, fcn: functionName, args: args, txId: tx_id, 'collections-config': collectionsConfigPath }; var endorsementResults = await channel.sendInstantiateProposal(request, time_out); // additional code needed to validate endorsementResults and send transaction to commit ...... Invoke chaincode to store and query private dataYou must be authorized to transact with the private data based on the policy defined in collection definition. Recall that the above collection definition allows all members of Org1 and Org2 to access collectionMarbles (name, color, size, and owner) in their private database, but only peers in Org1 can have access to collectionMarblePrivateDetails (price) in their private database. Acting as a member of Org1, you can do the following with marbles private data example, Invoke initMarble to create a marble with private data. Invoke readMarble to read name, color, size and owner from the private database for collectionMarbles. Invoke readMarblePrivateDetails to read price from the private database for collectionMarblePrivateDetails. Purge private dataThe Hyperledger Fabric allows client applications to optionally purge the private data in a collection by setting the blockToLive property. This option may be needed when private data include personal or confidential information and transacting parties want to have a limited lifespan for these data. When blockToLive is set to a non-zero value in the collection definition file, Fabric will automatically purge the related private data after the specified number of blocks are committed. Client applications do not need to call any API. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-18T08:20:03+00:00 using the DocStrap template. "}}
